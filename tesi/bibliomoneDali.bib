	abstract = {The possible effects of soil microbial community structure on organic matter decomposition rates have been widely acknowledged, but are poorly understood. Understanding these relationships is complicated by the fact that microbial community structure and function are likely to both affect and be affected by organic matter quality and chemistry, thus it is difficult to draw mechanistic conclusions from field studies. We conducted a reciprocal soil inoculum × litter transplant laboratory incubation experiment using samples collected from a set of sites that have similar climate and plant species composition but vary significantly in bacterial community structure and litter quality. The results showed that litter quality explained the majority of variation in decomposition rates under controlled laboratory conditions: over the course of the 162-day incubation, litter quality explained nearly two-thirds (64 \%) of variation in decomposition rates, and a smaller proportion (25 \%) was explained by variation in the inoculum type. In addition, the relative importance of inoculum type on soil respiration increased over the course of the experiment, and was significantly higher in microcosms with lower litter quality relative to those with higher quality litter. We also used molecular phylogenetics to examine the relationships between bacterial community composition and soil respiration in samples through time. Pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial community composition explained 32 \% of the variation in respiration rates. However, equal portions (i.e., 16 \%) of the variation in bacterial community composition were explained by inoculum type and litter quality, reflecting the importance of both the meta-community and the environment in bacterial assembly. Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of changing microbial community composition on decomposition are likely to be smaller than the potential effects of climate change and/or litter quality changes in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations or atmospheric nutrient deposition.},

	abstract = {Changes to the metabolic profiles of soil microbial communities could have potential for use as early indicators of the impact of management or other perturbations on soil functioning and soil quality. We compared the relative susceptibility to management of microbial community metabolism with a number of soil organic matter (OM) and microbial parameters currently used as indicators of changes in soil biological quality. Following long-term cereal cropping, plots were subjected to a 16-month treatment period consisting of either a mixed cropping sequence of vetch, spring barley and clover or a continuous grass-clover ley which was periodically mown and mulched. The treatments had no effect on soil biomass N or respiration of microbial populations inoculated into Biolog Gram negative (GN) plates. After 16 months there were no management-induced changes to total OM, light-fraction OM C and N, labile organic N or water-soluble carbohydrates. However, patterns of substrate utilization by the soil microbial population following inoculation into Biolog GN plates were found to be highly sensitive to management practice. In the mixed cropping sequence, substrate utilization changed markedly following plough-in of the vetch crop, with a smaller change occurring after harvesting of the barley. In the ley treatment, substrate utilization was not affected until the onset of mowing, when the pattern changed to become similar to that in the mixed cropping sequence. Metabolic diversity of the Biolog-culturable microbial population was increased by the ley treatment, but was not affected by the cropping sequence. We conclude that patterns of microbial substrate utilization and metabolic diversity are more sensitive to the effects of management than are OM and biomass pools, and therefore have value as early indicators of the impacts of management on soil biological properties, and hence soil quality.},

	abstract = {This review discusses the analysis of whole-community phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and the composition of lipopolysaccharides in order to assess the microbial biomass and the community structure in soils. For the determination of soil microbial biomass a good correlation was obtained between the total amount of PLFAs and the microbial biomass measured with methods commonly used for determinations such as total adenylate content and substrate-induced respiration. Generally, after the application of multivariate statistical analyses, whole-community fatty acid profiles indicate which communities are similar or different. However, in most cases, the organisms accounting for similarity or difference cannot be determined, and therefore artefacts could not be excluded. The fatty acids used to determine the biomass vary from those which determine the community structure. Specific attention has to be paid when choosing extraction methods in order to avoid the liberation of fatty acids from non-living organic material and deposits, and to exclude the non-target selection of lipids from living organisms, as well. By excluding the fatty acids which were presumed to be common and widespread prior to multivariate statistical analysis, estimates were improved considerably. Results from principal component analysis showed that determining the levels of fatty acids present in both low and high concentrations is essential in order to correctly identify microorganisms and accurately classify them into taxonomically defined groups. The PLFA technique has been used to elucidate different strategies employed by microorganisms to adapt to changed environmental conditions under wide ranges of soil types, management practices, climatic origins and different perturbations. It has been proposed that the classification of PLFAs into a number of chemically different subgroups should simplify the evaluating procedure and improve the assessment of soil microbial communities, since then only the subgroups assumed to be involved in key processes would be investigated.},

	abstract = {Background and AimRoot-derived carbon (C) is preferentially retained in soil compared to aboveground C inputs. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere are crucial to nutrient and organic matter cycling within agroecosystems. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of crop management on microbial community structure and processing of rhizodeposit-C within microenvironments of two soil zones, the rhizosphere versus non-rhizosphere.MethodsNew root-C (Cnew) from 13C-labeled hairy vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) plants were traced into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) within microaggregate (53–250 μm) and silt-and-clay ({\textless}53 μm) microenvironments in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil during the cover crop growing season in long-term conventional (annual synthetic fertilizer applications), low-input (synthetic fertilizer and cover crop applied in alternating years), and organic (annual composted manure and cover crop additions) maize-tomato systems (Zea mays L.- Lycopersicum esculentum L.).ResultsAmong the three cropping systems, the composition of the microbial communities processing root-derived C were similar, which implied that the cropping systems maintained diverse microbial communities that were capable of utilizing similar C substrates despite receiving different long-term nutrient inputs. Relative distributions of root-derived PLFA-C (13C mol\%) in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere were not significantly different, thereby suggesting that the structure of the microbial community utilizing new root-C in the rhizosphere- and non-rhizosphere microenvironments were similar. However, total PLFA biomass was four times greater, and root-derived PLFA-C in both soil microenvironments were approximately 10 times greater in the rhizosphere than in the non-rhizosphere. Although no microbial group dominated the processing of Cnew in the microenvironments of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere, we found that the microbial community of the silt-and-clay in the rhizosphere played a different role in the cycling of Cnew compared to communities in the rhizosphere microaggregates and those in the silt-and-clay and microaggregates of the non-rhizosphere.ConclusionsOur results confirm that rhizodeposition plays an important role in the greater contribution of root-C than residue-C to SOM stabilization. This study also showed that microbial communities assimilating rhizodeposit-C are sensitive to their microenvironment (i.e., microaggregates versus silt-and-clay particles); nevertheless, differences in long-term crop management did not lead to differences in the capacity of the microbial communities to utilize active cover crop root-C substrates.},

	abstract = {The effects of plant species which frequently occur in set-aside arable land on rhizosphere soil properties were assessed and compared to rhizosphere soil of Secale cereale (Rye) grown on an intensively managed arable soil (sandy Cambisol, Saxony, NE-Germany). On a 6 year old set-aside arable land rhizosphere soil samples were taken under Agropyron repens, Cirsium arvense and Rumex acetosa, the most frequent plant species, and under the leguminous plant species Vicia villosa. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) has been used to characterise the structure of the soil microbial community. Carbon mineralisation rates as well as gross (15N isotope pool dilution method) and net nitrogen mineralisation rates were determined as indicator of microbial activity. In intensive managed plots a rhizosphere effect was obvious in higher nutrient contents, gross N mineralisation rates and higher relative abundances of fungi and protozoa in Rye rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Plant species altered rhizosphere microbial activity. Lowest gross N mineralisation and gross NH4 consumption rates were detected in Rye rhizosphere soil. Both rates revealed high positive correlations with dissolved organic carbon (extracted with KCl) and soil pH. The rhizosphere soil microbial communities of the three dominant plant species of the set-aside arable land (Agropyron, Cirsium, Rumex) were more similar to each other than to Vicia grown on the same set-aside plots and Rye grown on intensive managed plots. The highest number of non-identified PLFAs detected in Vicia rhizosphere soil suggests that microbial diversity was highest. Differences in quantity and quality of Vicia rhizodeposition, especially higher N contents, seem to induce the higher microbial activity and different microbial community structure. The rhizosphere soil of the dominant plant species on the set-aside and intensively managed arable land reflected the differences in bulk soil properties (obtained in a previous study) between the two management systems (e.g. pH, gross N mineralisation, metabolic quotient, PLFA marker characteristic of G− bacteria and fungi).},

However, compared to the 90-year-old forest, the tea garden soils showed significantly higher genetic diversity. PLFA analysis showed that the ratio of Gram positive bacteria to Gram negative bacteria was significantly higher in the tea garden soils than in the wasteland, and the highest value was found in the 90-year-old forest. Both the fungal PLFA and the ratio of fungi to bacteria were significantly higher in the three tea garden soils than in the wasteland and forest, indicating that fungal PLFA was significantly affected by land-use change.

	abstract = {Many world ecosystems are in various states of decline evidenced by erosion, low productivity, and poor water quality caused by forest clearing, intensive agricultural production, and continued use of land resources for purposes that are not sustainable. The biological diversity of these systems is being altered. Little research has been conducted to quantify the beneficial relationships between microbial diversity, soil and plant quality, and ecosystem sustainability. Ecosystem functioning is governed largely by soil microbial dynamics. Differences in microbial properties and activities of soils have been reported but are restricted to general ecological enumeration methods or activity levels, which are limited in their ability to describe a particular ecosystem. Microbial populations and their responses to stresses have been traditionally studied at the process level, in terms of total numbers of microorganisms, biomass, respiration rates, and enzyme activities, with little attention being paid to responses at the community or the organismal levels. These process level measurements, although critical to understanding the ecosystem, may be insensitive to community level changes due to the redundancy of these functions. As microbial communities comprise complex interactions between diverse organisms, they should be studied as such, and not as a “black box” into which inputs are entered and outputs are received at measured rates. Microbial communities and their processes need to be examined in relation to not only the individuals that comprise the community, but the effect of perturbations or environmental stresses on those communities.},

Crop rotation and organic management practices are thought to have positive impacts on the microbial biomass; however, the specific impacts of crop rotation organic management on soil microbial ecology are largely unknown. The effect of organic management on soil microbial ecology was investigated using soils collected from the Rodale Institute Research Center's long-term Farming Systems Trial (FST) experiment. The FST, begun in 1981, included a manured and a cover cropped organic rotation and a conventionally managed grain based rotation. Soil respiration rates and13C-isotope fate in a companion study suggest that the biomass characteristics of the FST treatment soils were different in November 1991. However, direct measurement of the microbial community at this time using Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA) did not identify statistically significant treatment based differences in soil biomass characteristics. Variability among the PLFA profiles of treatment replicates was as great as variability between farming systems. Treatment based trends were observed among selected PLFAs, particularly those present in large amounts, that were consistent with indirect biomass and biomass-dependent measures. Overall, PLFA profiles, soil respiration rates and13C-cycling suggested that the organic cover cropped soil had the Largest and most heterogeneous microbial population while the biomass of the organic-manure amended soil was the least heterogeneous, and the most metabolically active.},

	abstract = {Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were measured in soils from organic, low-input, and conventional farming systems that are part of the long term Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project. The farming systems differ in whether their source of fertilizer is mineral or organic, and in whether a winter cover crop is grown. Sustained increases in microbial biomass resulting from high organic matter inputs have been observed in the organic and low-input systems. PLFA profiles were compared to ascertain whether previously observed changes in biomass were accompanied by a change in the composition of the microbial community. In addition, the relative importance of environmental variables on PLFA profiles was determined. Redundancy analysis ordination showed that PLFA profiles from organic and conventional systems were significantly different from April to July. On ordination plots, PLFA profiles from the low-input system fell between organic and conventional systems on most sample dates. A group of fatty acids (i14:0, a15:0, 16:1ω7c, 16:1ω5c, 14:0, and 18:2ω6c) was enriched in the organic plots throughout the sampling period, and another group (10Me16:0, 2OH 16:1 and 10Me17:0) was consistently lower in relative abundance in the organic system. In addition, another group (15:0, a17:0, i16:0, 17:0, and 10Me18:0) was enriched over the short term in the organic plots after compost incorporation. The relative importance of various environmental variables in governing the composition of microbial communities could be ranked in the order: soil type {\textgreater} time {\textgreater} specific farming operation (e.g., cover crop incorporation or sidedressing with mineral fertilizer) {\textgreater} management system {\textgreater} spatial variation in the field. Measures of the microbial community and soil properties (including microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, substrate induced respiration, basal respiration, potentially mineralizable nitrogen, soil nitrate and ammonium, and soil moisture) were seldom associated with the variation in the PLFA profiles.},

	abstract = {. Microbial community responses to alternative management may be indicative of soil quality change. In this study, soils were collected from research plots over 2 years and from commercial grower fields over 1 year. Treatments at the sites included 1–9 years of either winter cover cropping or winter fallow practices. Soils were assayed for microbial fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), direct count microscopy and Biolog substrate utilization potentials to assess management and environmental influences on soil communities. The strongest influence was season. Soils in early spring (prior to termination of the cover crop) utilized fewer carboxylic acids and generally were enriched in eukaryotic FAMEs, whereas proportionally more bacterial FAMEs were detected in soils at canopy closure and harvest of the summer vegetable crop. Within a season, community FAME and Biolog patterns were related to field properties. FAME profiles from grower fields in early spring and harvest were correlated significantly with soil texture, cation exchange capacity, and carbon content. Changes in community structure and Biolog potential occurred in some soils in response to winter cover crops, although effects were not observed until cover crop incorporation. Greater amounts of fungal and protozoan FAME markers were detected in some cover-cropped soils compared to winter fallow soils. Cover crop residues increased FAME diversity at one research station and Biolog diversity at two research stations and the grower fields. Although seasonal and field-dependent factors are major determinants of microbial community structure, shifts can occur as soil physical and chemical properties change in response to alternative practices, as demonstrated by this study.},

All three techniques showed that the rhizosphere bacterial community differed from the bulk soil community, when pea plants were grown in pots. The two PLFA techniques also indicated that the effect of roots on microbial communities was greater than differences in the PLFA pattern between different bulk soils. The difference was most prominent using the direct soil–PLFA technique. Both PLFA techniques indicated that gram-negative bacteria were relatively more abundant in the rhizosphere, while PLFAs indicative of gram-positive bacteria were relatively more common in bulk soil samples. The results obtained with the direct soil–PLFA method did not differ between rhizosphere samples taken along a pea root, while this was the case with both the cfu–PLFA technique and the CLPP method. According to both techniques, the differences in community composition were greatest near the root tip. Different plant species exhibited different microbial community composition in the rhizosphere, as judged from all three methods, when four different plant species were compared. In all cases, Trifolium differed most from the other species (three different grasses). Although all three methods were found to be suitable for rhizosphere studies, the CLPP method appeared less suitable than the two PLFA methods, since less of the variation in the data could usually be explained.},

	abstract = {Two sandstone-derived soils under pure stands of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were studied to determine if the fine earth (\&lt;2 mm material) and two size-classes of porous rock fragments (\&gt;2 mm material) supported different microbial communities. Samples from three soil horizons (A, Bw, and BC) were analysed under both optical and scanning electron microscopes. Small stones (2–10 mm in average diameter) appeared more altered than larger ones (40–60 mm) and the effects of weathering became more obvious with shallower depth. In both soils, numerous hyphae and other living forms were observed on the surface of the stones from the A and Bw horizons; this contrasted with the stones from the BC horizon, which showed little or no colonisation. The microbial community of each fraction was characterised using Biolog-Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) and phospholipid fatty acid analyses (PLFA) for samples in the A and B horizons. Significant potential microbial activity (C source utilisation) was associated with rock fragments, from the A horizon and, to a lesser extent, the B, although this was lower than for the equivalent fine earth fraction. The microbial colonisation of the stones appeared inversely related with their size and sampling depth. The PLFA analysis showed not only quantitative differences in the microbial biomass between horizons and size-fractions but also highlighted that the communities differed between soils, horizons (for the sole beech soil) and fractions. These findings demonstrate that by considering rock fragments as a microbiologically inert fraction and discarding them before analysis, as usually is done, can lead to an incomplete picture of both the total amount and, perhaps more importantly, the structure of soil microbial community.},

Experimental chambers were planted with the grass Hordelymus europeaus L. (Poaceae) and three compartments separated by 45-μm mesh were established: rhizosphere, intermediate and non-rhizosphere. The experiment lasted for 16 weeks and the following parameters were measured at the end of the experiment: shoot and root mass of H. europaeus, carbon and nitrogen content in shoots and roots, density of ciliates, amoebae, flagellates and nematodes, microbial biomass (SIR), basal respiration, streptomycin sensitive respiration, ammonium and nitrate contents, phosphate content of soil compartments. In addition, leaching of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and leachate pH were measured at regular intervals in leachate obtained from suction cups in the experimental chambers. Protozoa stimulated the recovery of nitrifying bacteria following defaunation (by chloroform fumigation) and increased nitrogen losses as nitrate in leachate. In contrast, protozoa and nematodes reduced leaching of phosphate, an effect ascribed to stimulation of microbial growth early in the experiment. Earthworms strongly increased the amount of extractable mineral nitrogen whereas it was strongly reduced by protozoa and nematodes. Both protozoa and nematodes reduced the stimulatory effect of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization. Microbial biomass, basal respiration, and numbers of protozoa and nematodes increased in the vicinity of the root. Protozoa generally caused a decrease in microbial biomass whereas nematodes and earthworms reduced microbial biomass only in the absence of protozoa. None of the animals studied significantly affected basal respiration, but specific respiration of microorganisms (O2 consumption per unit biomass) was generally higher in animal treatments. The stimulatory effect of nematodes and earthworms, however, occurred only in the absence of protozoa. The sensitivity of respiration to streptomycin suggested that protozoa selectively grazed on bacterial biomass but the bacterial/fungal ratio appeared to be unaffected by grazing of P. pellio. Earthworms reduced root biomass of H. europaeus, although shoot biomass remained unaffected, and concentrations of nitrogen in shoots and particularly in roots were strongly increased by earthworms. Both nematodes and protozoa increased plant biomass, particularly that of roots. This increase in plant biomass was accompanied by a marked decrease in nitrogen concentrations in roots and to a lesser extent in shoots. Generally, the effects of protozoa on plant growth considerably exceeded those of nematodes. It is concluded that nematodes and protozoa stimulated plant growth by non-nutritional effects, whereas the effects of earthworms were caused by an increase in nutrient supply to H. europaeus.},

In the amended plots total and humified organic C, Pb, Cu, and Zn showed a significant increase compared with nonamended plots. Enzymatic activities (L-asparaginase, arylsulphatase, dehydrogenase, phosphodiesterase, and alkaline phosphomonoesterase) were significantly enhanced by the compost addition thus indicating no inhibiting influence of the heavy metals present. The increased levels of the arylsulphatase, dehydrogenase, phosphodiesterase, and phosphomonoesterase activities were significantly correlated with total porosity: the first three with pores ranging from 50 to 1000 Î¼m, mainly with pores 50 to 200 Î¼m in size and phosphomonoesterase only with pores whose size was},

	abstract = {The loss of organic and inorganic carbon from roots into soil underpins nearly all the major changes that occur in the rhizosphere. In this review we explore the mechanistic basis of organic carbon and nitrogen flow in the rhizosphere. It is clear that C and N flow in the rhizosphere is extremely complex, being highly plant and environment dependent and varying both spatially and temporally along the root. Consequently, the amount and type of rhizodeposits (e.g. exudates, border cells, mucilage) remains highly context specific. This has severely limited our capacity to quantify and model the amount of rhizodeposition in ecosystem processes such as C sequestration and nutrient acquisition. It is now evident that C and N flow at the soil–root interface is bidirectional with C and N being lost from roots and taken up from the soil simultaneously. Here we present four alternative hypotheses to explain why high and low molecular weight organic compounds are actively cycled in the rhizosphere. These include: (1) indirect, fortuitous root exudate recapture as part of the root’s C and N distribution network, (2) direct re-uptake to enhance the plant’s C efficiency and to reduce rhizosphere microbial growth and pathogen attack, (3) direct uptake to recapture organic nutrients released from soil organic matter, and (4) for inter-root and root–microbial signal exchange. Due to severe flaws in the interpretation of commonly used isotopic labelling techniques, there is still great uncertainty surrounding the importance of these individual fluxes in the rhizosphere. Due to the importance of rhizodeposition in regulating ecosystem functioning, it is critical that future research focuses on resolving the quantitative importance of the different C and N fluxes operating in the rhizosphere and the ways in which these vary spatially and temporally.},

The biological diversity of these systems is being altered. Little research has been conducted to quantify the beneficial relationships between microbial diversity, soil and plant quality, and ecosystem sustainability. Ecosystem functioning is governed largely by soil microbial dynamics. Differences in microbial properties and activities of soils have been reported but are restricted to general ecological enumeration methods or activity levels, which are limited in their ability to describe a particular ecosystem. Microbial populations and their responses to stresses have been traditionally studied at the process level, in terms of total numbers of microorganisms, biomass, respiration rates, and enzyme activities, with little attention being paid to responses at the community or the organismal levels. These process level measurements, although critical to understanding the ecosystem, may be insensitive to community level changes due to the redundancy of these functions. As microbial communities comprise complex interactions between diverse organisms, they should be studied as such, and not as a “black box” into which inputs are entered and outputs are received at measured rates. Microbial communities and their processes need to be examined in relation to not only the individuals that comprise the community, but the effect of perturbations or environmental stresses on those communities.},

The moder forest has lower species numbers with only few species dominating, lower faunal biomass (c5 g dry mass.m-2), and higher numbers of mesofaunal, microphytophagous animals. The mull soil fauna penetrates to deeper soil horizons. Under moder soil conditions the biomass of the mesofauna tends to fluctuate widely. In terms of energy flow, the soil animal community is of similar importance in both humus types, but the predominance of macrofauna in the mull system contributes to higher decomposition rates. The moder soil biota is apparently more sensitive to stress factors, which leads to a more seasonal pattern of C and N mineralisation. -from Authors},

The sheer abundance of species in the soil (millions·m−2), our naïvete of soil biodiversity at the species or molecular level for groups such as bacteria, fungi, and microinvertebrates, the complexity of relationships of soil biodiversity to vegetation type and ecosystem functioning, and the limited studies on the effect of long-term elevated atmospheric CO2 and soil warming on soil species diversity contribute to our uncertainty of the impact of global change drivers on soil biodiversity. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the composition and abundance of many groups of soil biota are affected, at local and regional scales, by changes in vegetation, soil physical and chemical habitat, climate, and invasive species (Bongers 1990; Ruess 1995). These changes in soil biota are important because they are linked to critical ecosystem processes that sustain life. Soil degradation has accelerated globally as human populations have expanded, threatening the stability of Earth’s ecosystems. Determining how soil species diversity will change under global change drivers will help scientists, policy makers, and managers devise and implement strategies to preserve and maintain our terrestrial ecosystems for the long term.},

This relatively simple assay can be performed on fresh, frozen or frozen-lyophilized sediment samples with chloroform methanol extraction and subsequent phosphate determination. The sedimentary lipid phosphate recovery correlates with the extractible ATP and the rate of DNA synthesis. Pulse-chase experiments show active metabolism of the sedimentary phospholipids. The recovery of added 14C-labeled bacterial lipids from sediments is quantitative. Replicate analyses from a single sediment sample gave a standard deviation of 11\%. The lipid extract can be fractionated by relatively simple procedures and the plasmalogen, diacyl phospholipid, phosphonolipid and non-hydrolyzable phospholipid content determined. The relative fatty acid composition can be readily determined by gas-liquid chromatography.The lipid composition can be used to define the microbial community structure. For example, the absence of polyenoic fatty acids indicates minimal contamination with benthic micro-eukaryotes. Therefore the high content of plasmalogen phospholipids in these sediments suggests that the anaerobic prokaryotic Clostridia are found in the aerobic sedimentary horizon. This would require anaerobic microhabitats in the aerated zones.},

We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer’s fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index. Visual soil evaluation techniques also provide a useful visual aid for improving soil awareness in groups of stakeholders, helping the exchange of knowledge and ideas for innovation in agriculture.},

	abstract = {Una completa ricostruzione storica della peste travalica la semplice storia della medicina. Ancora oggi parole come malattia, contagio e morte spaventano, nonostante nei paesi industrializzati sia stata debellata la maggior parte delle epidemie che in passato hanno colpito l'umanità. La paura e la sofferenza di intere popolazioni annientate da pandemie sono testimoniate fin dai più antichi scritti: se ne trova traccia nei testi geroglifici egiziani e in quelli cuneiformi della Mesopotamia. Violente epidemie funestarono l'antica Cina e imperversarono durante la guerra di Troia, così come fecero la peste nera nell'Europa del 1300 e il vaiolo nel XV secolo. E la storia insegna come le grandi pestilenze si siano presentate con un andamento ciclico a lunghi intervalli di tempo, fino ancora a non molti anni fa. La pratica delle vaccinazioni e l'attenzione per l'igiene pubblica segnano una tappa fondamentale nel XX secolo nella lotta dell'Occidente contro le epidemie. Se oggi appare inscindibile il legame tra epidemia e contagio, ci sono voluti molti secoli prima che medici e studiosi ne cogliessero la relazione. Il libro di William Hardy McNeill è il testo più completo a riguardo, l'opera principale che racchiude anni e anni di ricerca, attraverso l'analisi di dati e testimonianze, del più grande studioso in materia.},

	abstract = {Crop residue addition is a way to increase soil organic matter (SOM) level in croplands. However, organic matter input and SOM stocks are not linearly related. Consequently, adding high amounts of residues, such as straw, may increase SOM to only a small extent, and an alternative use of the residues may be justified. The objective of this study was to test how the level and type (above- or belowground) of residue addition affect SOM stabilization. We hypothesise that (1) root residues will be mineralised slower than leaf and stalk residues, (2) soil aggregate formation will increase with high additions, and (3) wheat residue addition will induce positive priming, with the magnitude depending on the residue level and type. Homogeneously 13C-labelled wheat residues (leaves, stalks, roots) were added to a silt-loam soil at levels of 1.40 and 5.04 g DM kg− 1 and CO2 release and δ13C signature were measured over 64 days at 20 °C. Water-stable macroaggregates (\&gt; 250 μm), microaggregates (53–250 μm) and silt plus clay size fractions (\&lt; 53 μm) were separated and 13C incorporation from residue was quantified in each fraction after 64 days. Aggregate formation generally increased with added residue amount, but the proportion of residues occluded within aggregates decreased with increasing addition level. The occlusion of residues from aboveground biomass was more reduced with addition level than that of roots. Residue mineralisation increased with the addition level, but this increase was less for roots compared to stalks and leaves. Priming effects were similar between residue types and mainly depended on the added amount: SOM mineralisation increased by 50\% and 90\% at low and high addition levels, respectively. We conclude that the proportion of residues physically protected within aggregates decreases and priming effects increase with increasing C input leading to decreasing rate of long-term C stabilization within SOM by increasing residue addition.},

	abstract = {In permanent no-till (NT), soil nutrients are no longer mixed into the topsoil as with moldboard plow/disking (MD), whereas chisel/disking (CD) does limited mixing. Surface broadcast and/or banded nutrient applications may result in high and low fertility zones in permanent NT, with possible implications for soil sampling and nutrient placement. We investigated effects of 25 years of continuous NT, CD and MD with corn planted in the same row locations on organic matter (SOM), pH-H2O and Mehlich-3 extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Vertical distribution at 0–5, 5–10 and 10–15 cm depths was measured as well as horizontal distributions across corn rows. We observed higher SOM and P in NT and CD than in MD in the 0–15 cm layer. SOM content was greatest in the top 5 cm in NT, but declined sharply with depth. SOM content in CD was not as high at the surface as in NT, but did not decline as fast as in NT. SOM was uniform but low throughout the 0–15 cm depth of MD. In all tillage systems, SOM did not vary across rows. Soil pH was higher in the 0–5 cm layer of NT than the deeper layers but the reverse was true in the CD or MD treatments. Concentrations of P, K and Ca were higher in the surface 0–5 cm than 10–15 cm depth of all tillage systems, but most strikingly in NT and CD. Starter fertilizer injection resulted in higher P and lower pH in the injection zone of all tillage treatments, but most notably in NT. The pH was depressed under the band of side-dressed nitrogen with all tillage systems. Potassium accumulated in the rows of the previous crop, probably because it leached from crop residue that accumulated there. Tillage did not affect Mg distribution. Optimal nutrient management in NT should take account of horizontal and vertical nutrient and pH distributions. Samples in long-term NT could potentially be taken to a shallower depth if calibration curves are available. To avoid underestimating P and K availability or overestimate lime needs, high P or decreased pH bands should be avoided, as well as crop rows. Possibilities to reduce P and K applications with banding need more investigation. Results show the importance of regular liming in NT to maintain surface pH in the optimum range, but also show that lime does not have to be incorporated.},

	abstract = {Much of the biodiversity of agroecosystems lies in the soil. The functions performed by soil biota have major direct and indirect effects on crop growth and quality, soil and residue-borne pests, diseases incidence, the quality of nutrient cycling and water transfer, and, thus, on the sustainability of crop management systems. Farmers use tillage, consciously or inadvertently, to manage soil biodiversity. Given the importance of soil biota, one of the key challenges in tillage research is understanding and predicting the effects of tillage on soil ecology, not only for assessments of the impact of tillage on soil organisms and functions, but also for the design of tillage systems to make the best use of soil biodiversity, particularly for crop protection. In this paper, we first address the complexity of soil ecosystems, the descriptions of which vary between studies, in terms of the size of organisms, the structure of food webs and functions. We then examine the impact of tillage on various groups of soil biota, outlining, through examples, the crucial effects of tillage on population dynamics and species diversity. Finally, we tackle the question of the design of tillage systems to enhance biological control in cultivated fields. Identification of the optimal tillage system requires a global consideration of soil management, rather than an analysis focusing on tillage alone, taking into account soil ecology. Organic residue management, the prevention of compaction, crop rotation and the timing of cultivation must all be considered together, taking into account their impact on pest populations and on the natural enemies of pests and ecosystem engineers. This approach requires more detailed research and careful experimental design than traditional comparisons of conventional and reduced tillage systems. We propose the development of population modeling in cultivated fields, as the available ecological models rarely include parameters linked to the soil management system.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term (less than 2 years) conservation managements [no-tillage (NT) and crop residue returning] on top soil (0–5 cm) microbial community composition and soil organic C (SOC) fractions under a rice-wheat rotation at Junchuan town of Hubei Province, China. Treatments were established following a split-plot design of a randomized complete block with tillage practices [conventional tillage (CT) and NT] as the main plot and residue returning level [no residue returning (0) and all residues returned to fields from the preceding crop (S, 2,146 kg C ha−1)] as the subplots. The four treatments were CT with or without residue returning (CT0 and CTS) and NT with or without residue returning (NT0 and NTS). The abundances of microbial groups [total FLFAs, fungal biomass, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass/bacterial biomass (F/B), monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), and microbial stress] were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis of soil. The ratio of MUFA/STFA reflects aeration of soil and greater MUFA/STFA means better aeration condition of soil. Moreover, the microbial stress, the ratio of cy19:0 to 18:1ω7, was regarded as an indicator of physiological or nutritional stress of microbial community. PLFA profiles were dominated by the fatty acids iC15:0 (9.8 \%), C16:0 (16.5 \%), 10Me17:0 (9.9 \%), and Cyc19:0 (8.3 \%), together accounting for 44.6 \% of the total PLFAs. Compared with CT, NT significantly increased microbial biomass C (MBC) by 20.0 \% but did not affect concentrations of total organic C (TOC), dissolved organic C (DOC), easily oxidizable C (EOC), and SOC of aggregates. Residue returning significantly increased MBC by 18.3 \% and SOC content of 2–1-mm aggregate by 9.4 \%. NT significantly increased total PLFAs by 9.8 \% and fungal biomass by 40.8 \% but decreased MUFA/STFA by 15.5 \%. Residue returning significantly enhanced total PLFAs, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass, F/B, and MUFA/STFA by 31.1, 36.0, 95.9, 42.5, and 58.8 \%, respectively, but decreased microbial stress by 45.9 \%. Multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis and partial correlation analysis) indicated that SOC of 2–1-mm aggregate was related to changes in the composition of soil microbial groups, suggesting that SOC of 2–1-mm aggregate was sensitive to changes in soil microbial community composition affected by short-term conservation management practices in our study.},

Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimetres. Biologic influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of aggregates but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies which create aggregations of particles and those which stabilize or degrade such aggregations.

The formation of soil structure involves the physical forces of shrinking and swelling created by changes in water status of soils, freezing and thawing, tillage, or by movement of the larger biota in soils. Expansive properties of soils are controlled by the clay content. Thus changes of structural organisation are minimal in sands and maximal in clays. Plant roots, earthworms and other macrofauna large enough to move soil particles create pores recognisable by cylindrical shapes and smooth curved surfaces. Various visual and microscopic techniques aided by dyes are available to demonstrate the extent of biovoids in soils.

Biology plays a major role in stabilization of soil structure. The major factors vary depending on the scale of soil structure. At larger scales plant roots and associated hyphae can be seen to enmesh soil particles by acting as a “sticky string bag”. At the microscale the influence of mucilages from roots, hyphae, bacteria and fauna such as earthworms can be shown by a range of microscopic techniques to be involved in stabilizing smaller aggregates and the linings of biopores. Techniques include optical and fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy including EDAX, transmission electron microscopy using heavy metals or other electron dense staining techniques for specific chemical compounds, and computer aided tomography. The microscopic techniques can be used on individual aggregates, stabilized soils, sections or separates of soils.

Both microflora and fauna are involved in the degradation of stabilizing agents. Fauna may comminute roots and hyphae which stabilized larger aggregates and microorganisms utilize mucilaginous stabilizing agents as an energy source resulting in a slow breakdown of structural stability. Such effects can be established by combinations of studies of aggregation including microscopy. Further destruction of structure is caused by tillage and compaction by vehicles and animals.},

Soil bulk density was measured using a nuclear gauge pre-harvest and post-harvest systematically across the harvest unit and on transects across skid trails. Bulk density also was measured in the skid trails in a subset of the transects after the first 10 loaded machine passes. Post-harvest soil bulk density of 954.4 kg/m³ was not significantly different from the pre-harvest bulk density of 925.2 kg/m³ across the site. Grapple skidding resulted in significant bulk density changes in the skid trails. Results suggest that most of the soil bulk density changes in the skid trails occurred after the first loaded machine pass. Our findings suggest that the use of tracked feller-bunchers to fell and bunch the trees results in the minimum changes to soil bulk density across a harvest site.},

	abstract = {Soil management practices may change the soil properties. The magnitude of the change varies according to the soil property, the climate, and the type and time of implementation of a particular management system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of no-tillage (NT) on the chemical and biological properties of an Entic Haploxeroll in Central Chile. Soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass and associated indicators q CO 2 , qMic, qMin, available N, P and K, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and crop yield were determined in a field experiment having a wheat (Triticum turgidum L.)–maize (Zea mays L.) crop rotation. The change in soil chemical properties was further evaluated using a greenhouse bioassay in which ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in soil samples extracted at 0–2, 2–5, and 5–15 cm depth. After nine years SOC in the NT treatment was 29.7 Mg ha−1 compared to 24.8 Mg ha−1 of CT, resulting in 4.98 Mg ha−1 C gain. The NT therefore resulted in an average annual sequestration of 0.55 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the upper 15 cm soil. The soil organic C stored under NT was mainly accumulated in the top 2-cm of soil. The biological indicators showed a greater biological soil quality under NT than under CT. Soil organic C was positively associated with available N, P, and K, but negatively with soil pH. The ryegrass bioassay yielded higher biomass in NT than CT. An improvement in the soil chemical quality of the NT soil was considered to be the main reason for this result. The maize yield under NT had the tendency to improve in time as compared to CT. Wheat, however, had lower yield under NT. It was concluded that NT increased C sequestration and SOC improving the chemical and biological properties of this soil.},

	abstract = {New non-tillage or reduced tillage agricultural practises are being increasingly adopted but generally result in higher soil compaction. Due to their recognised physical influence mainly through burrow creation, it is often claimed that earthworm activity could alleviate soil compaction in these systems. To put this assumption to the test, an experimental compaction event was carried out on one plot of arable land. The abundance and biomass of earthworms were evaluated in compacted (under wheel tracks) and non-compacted (between wheel tracks) zones, seven times over a two-year period. In addition, the functional consequences of earthworm activity, defined by burrow abundance assessed in 2D and 3D and water infiltration, were measured three times over the same period. The short-term (less than three months) effects of the compaction were clear: soil bulk density increased from 1.46 to 1.57 g cm−3, the abundance and biomass of earthworms were greatly reduced (−40\% and −70\% respectively) and the number and continuity of macroporosity were lower under wheel tracks at least until a depth of 30 cm. After these initial detrimental effects, we observed a rapid recovery of earthworm populations with no statistical difference between compacted and control zones more than three months after the compaction. However, the recovery of soil functional properties linked to earthworm activity, macroporosity and water infiltration, was much slower and took between 12 and 24 months. Despite these modifications, there were no significant changes in soil bulk density with time during the two-year period. This study demonstrates that earthworms are important actors in the regeneration of compacted soil. Although the complete regeneration of compacted soil by earthworms is a slow process, agricultural practises that promote earthworm density and activity should be encouraged in reduced or minimum tillage systems.},

	abstract = {Soil compaction is an important component of the land degradation syndrome which is an issue for soil management throughout the world. It is a long standing phenomenon not only associated with agriculture but also with forest harvesting, amenity land use, pipeline installation, land restoration and wildlife trampling. This review concentrates on the impact of soil compaction on practical soil management issues, an area not previously reviewed. It discusses in the context of the current situation, the causes, identification, effects and alleviation of compaction. The principal causes are when compressive forces derived from wheels, tillage machinery and from the trampling of animals, act on compressible soil. Compact soils can also be found under natural conditions without human or animal involvement. Compaction alters many soil properties and adverse effects are mostly linked to a reduction in permeability to air, water and roots. Many methods can be used to measure the changes. In practical situations, the use of visual and tactile methods directly in the field is recommended. The worst problems tend to occur when root crops and vegetables are harvested from soils at or wetter than field capacity. As discussed by a farmer, the effects on crop uniformity and quality (as well as a reduction in yield) can be marked. By contrast, rendzinas and other calcareous soils growing mainly cereals are comparatively free of compaction problems. The effect of a given level of compaction is related to both weather and climate; where soil moisture deficits are large, a restriction in root depth may have severe effects but the same level of compaction may have a negligible effect where moisture deficits are small. Topsoil compaction in sloping landscapes enhances runoff and may induce erosion particularly along wheeltracks, with consequent off-farm environmental impacts. Indirect effects of compaction include denitrification which is likely to lead to nitrogen deficiency in crops. The effects of heavy tractors and harvesters can to some extent be compensated for by a reduction in tyre pressures although there is concern that deep-seated compaction may occur. Techniques for loosening compaction up to depths of 45 cm are well established but to correct deeper problems presents difficulties. Several authors recommend that monitoring of soil physical conditions, including compaction, should be part of routine soil management.},

Total organochlorine phytoextraction by ssp. pepo increased at least 25\% in the presence of any of the earthworm species (relative to plants grown in isolation). Uptake of the compound by ssp. ovifera was unaffected by earthworms. Plants influenced earthworm bioaccumulation as well. When combined with pepo, p,p′-DDE levels in E. fetida decreased by 50\%, whereas, in the presence of ovifera, bioconcentration by L. terrestris increased by more than 2-fold. Spectral analysis indicated a decrease in hydrophobicity of HA in each of the soils in which both pepo and earthworms were present. However, HA chemistry from ovifera treatments was largely unaffected by earthworms. Risk assessments of contaminated soils should account for species interactions, and SOM chemistry may be a useful indictor of pollutant bioaccumulation.},

	abstract = {Conservation tillage practices that entail no or reduced soil disturbance are known to help preserve or accumulate soil organic matter (OM). However, the underlying mechanisms especially at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study soil samples from 25-year-old experimental plots continuously cropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under no-tillage (NT) and chisel tillage (CT) were subjected to a new physical fractionation method to isolate dissolved OM, mineral-free particulate OM located outside aggregates (physically and chemically unprotected), OM occluded within both macroaggregates and microaggregates (weakly and strongly protected by physical mechanisms, respectively), and OM in intimate association with minerals (protected by chemical mechanisms). The whole soils and OM fractions were analyzed for organic C and N content and by modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The soil under NT stored 16\% more organic C and 5\% more N than the soil under CT. Compared to CT, NT increased free organic C content by 7\%, intra-macroaggregate organic C content by 20\%, intra-microaggregate organic C content by 63\%, and mineral-associated organic C content by 16\% and decreased dissolved organic C content by 11\%. The mineral-associated OM pool accounted for 65\% of the difference in total organic C content between NT and CT, whereas the intra-microaggregate OM only explained 18\%, intra-macroaggregate OM 14\%, and free OM 11\%. The NMR experiments revealed that the free and intra-aggregate OM fractions were dominated by crop-derived materials at different stages of decomposition, whereas the mineral-associated OM pool was predominately of microbial origin. Overall, our results indicate that microbes and microbial by-products associated with mineral surfaces and likely physically protected by entrapment within very small microaggregates constitute the most important pool of OM stabilization and C sequestration in soils under NT. Most probably the slower macroaggregate turnover in NT relative to CT boosts not only the formation of microaggregates and thereby the physical protection of crop-derived particulate OM, but more importantly the interaction between mineral particles and microbial material that results in the formation of very stable organo-mineral complexes.},

Originally, they were covered by “macchia,” a tangled mix of bushy species, or, in a few more fertile sites, by Quercus ilex L. Currently there are six land uses on the island: (1) pristine macchia, (2) groves of Olea europaea L. totally reinvaded by macchia, (3) degraded residual thickets of Q. ilex, (4) cropland, (5) recently abandoned pastures, and (6) stands of Pinus halepensis Mill. The related soils were analysed by solid-state cross polarisation/magic angle spinning 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to compare the spectroscopic properties of their organic pool. The prevalence of O-alkyl C over other C forms is evident in all cases, while there is large variability with respect to the alkyl C to aromatic C ratio between both the different soils, and the horizons of a same soil. On the whole, the results show that on Pianosa Island, human impact has profoundly altered not only the amount but also the quality of soil organic matter (SOM). The SOM residual of the dichromate oxidation in the Walkley–Black method—a widely used method to measure soil organic C—was also analysed by NMR. It comprised almost exclusively alkyl C and aromatic C, as a result of the removal of carbonyl and O-alkyl C. Most of the aromatic C seems to belong to charcoal.},

of soil samples taken at depths of 0-15 cm, two
years after the start of the experiments. In the minimum
tillage system, the respiratory activity, metabolic
quotient, mineralization index and phosphatase activity
were higher than those of the other tillage systems,
while a higher biomass value was found in the
ripper subsoiling system. The higher concentration of
crop residues in the surface layer and less alteration
to the soil structure, inherent in minimum tillage'
caused an increase in microbial metabolic activities.
Coxcr,ustoxs. After two yearc of using alternative
tillage systems, minimum tillage was revealed as particularly
favourable towards the development of rnicrobial
metabolic activities at depths of 0-15 cm, although
it did not influence the conservation of organic

	abstract = {Although reduced tillage is an agricultural practice reported to decrease soil erosion and external inputs while enhancing soil fertility, it has still rarely been adopted by European organic farmers. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term interactive effects of tillage (conventional (CT) vs. reduced (RT)) and fertilization (slurry (S) vs. composted manure/slurry (MCS)) on earthworms and microbial communities in a clay soil under spelt in an organic 6-year crop rotation. Earthworm populations (species, density and biomass, cocoons) were investigated by handsorting the soil nine years after initial implementation of the treatments. Soil microbial carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) were measured by chloroform-fumigation extraction and a simplified phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to separate for populations of bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Significantly increased total earthworm density in RT plots was mainly attributed to increased numbers of juveniles. Moreover, we found five times more cocoons with RT. Species richness was not affected by the treatments, but tillage treatments had differentially affected populations at the species-level. In addition, cluster analysis at the community level revealed two distinct groups of plots in relation to tillage treatments. In RT plots Cmic increased in the 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm soil layers, while PLFA concentrations indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa only increased in the topsoil. Lower bacteria-to-fungi ratios in the upper soil layer of RT plots indicated a shift to fungal-based decomposition of organic matter whereas a higher Cmic-to-Corg ratio pointed towards enhanced substrate availability. Slurry application decreased microbial biomass and enhanced density of juvenile anecic earthworms but overall fertilization effect was weak and no interactions with tillage were found. In conclusion, tillage is a major driver in altering communities of earthworms and microorganisms in arable soils. The use of reduced tillage provides an approach for eco-intensification by enhancing inherent soil biota functions under organic arable farming.},

	abstract = {In France, agronomists have studied the effects of cropping systems on soil structure using a field method based on a morphological description of soil structure. In this method, called “profil cultural” or soil profile in English, the soil structure of the tilled layer is observed on a vertical face of a pit. Subsoil and more especially the transition layer between topsoil and subsoil have not always been given specific consideration. However, these layers undergo the effect of cropping systems through soil compaction or smoothing/smearing. A more accurate quantification of earthworm macropores and cracks in the transition layer would enable a more precise evaluation of the agronomical potential of the soil, manifest in root development or water retention. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present the profil cultural method in detail, along with the improvements we have made to quantify the ability of roots to penetrate compacted zones in the transition layer. We propose two indicators: (i) number of earthworm burrows per m2 counted on a horizontal surface at the bottom of the transition layer in the soil pit (ii) cracking quantified by taking a 50-mm × 50-mm × 100-mm sample of soil from the transition layer and examining the number of cracks. Results from experiments on different tillage treatments are used to demonstrate why it is worthwhile to take into account cracks and earthworm activity. Soil profiles were examined in mouldboard ploughed and no tillage fields, and described using the profil cultural method and the new indicators. Root maps were also traced to observe the effect of soil structure on root growth. Preliminary results show that the classification of cracking and the quantification of the number of earthworm burrows per m2 can explain observed root development in subsoil. This first approach towards a better observation of subsoil structure and the effect it has on roots needs to be confirmed through further research, and especially via quantification and scoring of soil structure impact on roots.},

	abstract = {This work is concerned with the effect of five earthworm species on short-term soil dynamics through carbon (C) mineralisation and large soil aggregate characteristics (production, stability, organic matter content and composition) in laboratory experiments. We hypothesised that the influence of earthworms on soil behaviour depends on individual species and land use history. Substrates were a sequence of three similar luvisols that had been subjected to different land use histories and represented increasing C contents from 10 mg kg−1 (cropped soil), to 20 mg kg−1 (5-year-old pasture soil) and 33 mg kg−1 (permanent pasture soil). We found that relative C mineralisation was slower in pasture than in cropped soils, which can be explained by differences in the physical protection of soil organic matter (SOM). Land use history influenced (i) the amount of large macro-aggregate production through earthworm behaviour (casting activity), and (ii) the size distribution of water stable soil fractions within the large macro-aggregate produced. No effect of earthworm species on SOM composition was observed with near infrared spectrometry indicating that the chemistry of large macro-aggregates was mainly driven by land use type. Earthworm species had more pronounced effects on physical (large aggregate production and stability) than on biological (C mineralisation promotion) or biochemical (SOM composition) features. This paper shows that, although earthworm effects on soil processes are now obvious, a number of factors may interact in such complex systems so that we should hesitate to make generalisations.},

In that region, there is evidence of soil fertility decline which is attributed to past crop management practices. The questions addressed in this article are first, whether components of soil fertility can be improved by better management and second, by how much soil fertility would change. Soil fertility for crop production is considered in terms of soil organic carbon and nitrogen. A stochastic dynamic economic analysis of soil fertility management for wheat production is presented. A sequential analysis of first deriving the optimal nitrogen stock and application rates is followed by an assessment of tillage, stubble, and fertilizer strategies to obtain an optimal level of soil organic carbon. The recommended management practices are consistent with emerging management trends in the region. The derivation of optimal levels of soil fertility for agricultural purposes has other policy implications, which we discuss.},

Soil properties were analyzed under continuous chisel plough (CP) and ZT treatments from three trials with different duration and crop sequence. The following soil properties of A horizon were analyzed from 0 to 0.05 and from 0.10 to 0.15 m depths: bulk density, pore size distribution, pore origin distribution, aggregate stability index, infiltration rate and organic matter. Preferred pore orientation was carried out by introducing the sampling cylinders in vertical and horizontal direction and then discriminating by pore size. Total porosity of A horizon under CP was 3.5\% higher than under ZT. This could be attributed to macro and mesopores as well as to structural porosity. Aggregates were 30\% more stable in ZT than under CP in the top at 0.05 m due to a 21\% increase in organic matter. However, infiltration rate was not improved under ZT. Under ZT, there was a tendency of macropores to become orientated in parallel to the soil surface. This horizontal preferential macropore orientation was critical in determining water infiltration. The susceptibility to stratify the structure in the first centimeters of the soil under ZT was attributed to the predominance of soybean in the crop sequence.},

	abstract = {Long-term studies are crucial for quantifying tillage effects on productivity and soil fertility. Moldboard plow, chisel plow, spring disk, ridge-tillage, and no-tillage systems were evaluated after 32 years of a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and 27 years of continuous corn in central Iowa, U.S.A. Productivity was quantified using yield, while soil fertility status was evaluated by collecting four, 5-cm diameter soil cores to a depth of 0.9 m from each treatment, dividing them into four depth increments (0–15-, 15–30-, 30–60-, and 60–90-cm), analyzing them for bulk density (BD), NO3-N, NH4-N, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Mehlich-3 extractable P, K, Ca, Mg and DTPA-extractable Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, and interpreting the data using Iowa State University (ISU) guidelines. Production costs for each tillage and cropping system were also computed. To account for genetic and agronomic changes during the 30-year study period, yields were examined for establishment, maintenance, and intensification/recovery phases. Rotated corn yield averaged 8.6, 8.8, and 11.6 Mg ha−1 and soybean yield averaged 2.7, 3.2, and 3.4 Mg ha−1, respectively, for each of the phases. Continuous corn from 1988 to 2006 averaged 7.5 and 10.1 Mg ha−1 for the maintenance and intensification/recovery phases, respectively. Fixed plus variable machinery costs for corn ranged from 233 to 354 USD ha−1, while for soybean they ranged from 194 to 280 USD ha−1. Net returns to land, labor and management ranged from 233 to 269, 560 to 620, and 437 to 483 USD ha−1 for continuous corn, rotated corn, and rotated soybean, respectively. Based on 9-year (2003–2011) average grain prices and yields from this study, the corn–soybean rotation was twice as profitable as continuous corn. Soil-test P and K measurements, as well as calculated P and K removal, suggest that nutrient mining occurred during the course of this study. The soil-test data also indicate that further studies are needed regarding plant availability of subsoil K and its impact on fertilizer recommendations. Overall, we conclude that with good nutrient management and crop rotation, yield and soil fertility differences between no-tillage and more intensive tillage systems can be minimized and that no-till production can be profitable on glacial till derived soils.},

	abstract = {The relationship among cone index (CI), soil water content (θ) and bulk density (Db) plays a critical role in assessing soil physical conditions. To predict Db as functions of the measurements of CI and θ, a variety of semi-empirical CI-models have been established historically, however a study for validating these models has not been found. In this study four CI-models, one considered the penetration depth as variable but others did not, were evaluated under laboratory condition. The methodology was to use our own developed dual-sensor vertical penetrometer (DSVP) to simultaneously measure CI and volumetric soil water content (θv), and then to compare the bulk density (Db) core-measured to that model-predicted by the DSVP data. Two types of soil samples (silt-loam and clay) were tested. Because a previous study speculated that penetration depth could confound the CI measured, two depth-dependent factors were incorporated into each CI-model for validating this speculation. Our study found that two of the four models tested fit the experimental data with acceptable R2 (\&gt;0.70) and RMSE (\&lt;0.093 g cm−3). In contrast, the experimental results confirmed that CI in Model-1 had a peak value adapting a wide range of θ. More ever, the results indicated that the DSVP combined with Model-1 or Model-2 can be used as a tool to predict Db when CI and θ are simultaneously measured.},

The incorporation of M enhanced the rate of both heterotrophic degradation of glycine and subsequent autotrophic nitrification in direct relation to the amounts of M added. In soil amended with K, neither degradation nor nitrification was stimulated. The addition of M shortened the lag phase before nitrification was initiated, increased the pH of both the soil and the perfusates, and increased the rate, but not the extent, of oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. The addition of CaCO3 or MgCO3, but not of CaSO4, also enhanced the rate of nitrification. The effects observed may have resulted from the influence of M on the pH, buffering capacity, and other soil conditions necessary for maximum activity of nitrifying microorganisms.},

Polyphasic studies that used phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) in conjunction with community level physiological profiling (CLPP) or PCR-based molecular methods were analyzed in order to evaluate the power of each strategy to detect treatment effects on soil microbial community structure (MCS). We found no studies where CLPP or PCR-based methods differentiated treatments that were not also differentiated by PLFA. In 14 of 32 studies (44\%), PLFA differentiated treatments that were not resolved by CLPP analysis. In 5 of 25 studies (20\%), PLFA differentiated treatments that were not resolved by PCR-based methods. We discuss PLFA, CLPP, and PCR-based methods with respect to power to discriminate change in MCS versus potential for characterization of underlying population level changes.},

A good correlation was obtained (r{\textgreater}0.90) between the soil biomass and total EL-PLFA in the soils investigated, which ranged from forest soils to a variety of agricultural soils. Elucidation of the composition of the community structure was an additional task. Eukaryotes can be differentiated from bacteria by the presence of polyunsaturated and ω-hydroxy fatty acids, both of which were much more abundant in the OF layer of the forest soil than in the remaining samples. A relatively low proportion of monomethyl branched-chain saturated fatty acids was obtained in the forest OF horizon, these being indicators for Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes. Various subclasses of proteobacteria produce β and mid-chain hydroxy fatty acids, which occur primarily in agricultural soils. The ratios between monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids seem to be very useful parameters of soil environmental conditions. In addition, on the basis of the differences in composition of the NEL-PLFA and hydroxy fatty acids of lipopolysaccharides, clear indications for the community structure of various soils were obtained. In the forest soils much more abundant anaerobic micro-organisms and relatively less abundant proteobacteria were present than in the other soils. In the cultivated soils, however, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria was considerably higher. Furthermore, eukaryotes appeared to be pre-dominant in the soils once used for a manure deposit site.},

	abstract = {The possible effects of soil microbial community structure on organic matter decomposition rates have been widely acknowledged, but are poorly understood. Understanding these relationships is complicated by the fact that microbial community structure and function are likely to both affect and be affected by organic matter quality and chemistry, thus it is difficult to draw mechanistic conclusions from field studies. We conducted a reciprocal soil inoculum × litter transplant laboratory incubation experiment using samples collected from a set of sites that have similar climate and plant species composition but vary significantly in bacterial community structure and litter quality. The results showed that litter quality explained the majority of variation in decomposition rates under controlled laboratory conditions: over the course of the 162-day incubation, litter quality explained nearly two-thirds (64 \%) of variation in decomposition rates, and a smaller proportion (25 \%) was explained by variation in the inoculum type. In addition, the relative importance of inoculum type on soil respiration increased over the course of the experiment, and was significantly higher in microcosms with lower litter quality relative to those with higher quality litter. We also used molecular phylogenetics to examine the relationships between bacterial community composition and soil respiration in samples through time. Pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial community composition explained 32 \% of the variation in respiration rates. However, equal portions (i.e., 16 \%) of the variation in bacterial community composition were explained by inoculum type and litter quality, reflecting the importance of both the meta-community and the environment in bacterial assembly. Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of changing microbial community composition on decomposition are likely to be smaller than the potential effects of climate change and/or litter quality changes in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations or atmospheric nutrient deposition.},

We compared the relative susceptibility to management of microbial community metabolism with a number of soil organic matter (OM) and microbial parameters currently used as indicators of changes in soil biological quality. Following long-term cereal cropping, plots were subjected to a 16-month treatment period consisting of either a mixed cropping sequence of vetch, spring barley and clover or a continuous grass-clover ley which was periodically mown and mulched. The treatments had no effect on soil biomass N or respiration of microbial populations inoculated into Biolog Gram negative (GN) plates. After 16 months there were no management-induced changes to total OM, light-fraction OM C and N, labile organic N or water-soluble carbohydrates. However, patterns of substrate utilization by the soil microbial population following inoculation into Biolog GN plates were found to be highly sensitive to management practice. In the mixed cropping sequence, substrate utilization changed markedly following plough-in of the vetch crop, with a smaller change occurring after harvesting of the barley. In the ley treatment, substrate utilization was not affected until the onset of mowing, when the pattern changed to become similar to that in the mixed cropping sequence. Metabolic diversity of the Biolog-culturable microbial population was increased by the ley treatment, but was not affected by the cropping sequence. We conclude that patterns of microbial substrate utilization and metabolic diversity are more sensitive to the effects of management than are OM and biomass pools, and therefore have value as early indicators of the impacts of management on soil biological properties, and hence soil quality.},

	abstract = {This review discusses the analysis of whole-community phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and the composition of lipopolysaccharides in order to assess the microbial biomass and the community structure in soils. For the determination of soil microbial biomass a good correlation was obtained between the total amount of PLFAs and the microbial biomass measured with methods commonly used for determinations such as total adenylate content and substrate-induced respiration. Generally, after the application of multivariate statistical analyses, whole-community fatty acid profiles indicate which communities are similar or different. However, in most cases, the organisms accounting for similarity or difference cannot be determined, and therefore artefacts could not be excluded. The fatty acids used to determine the biomass vary from those which determine the community structure. Specific attention has to be paid when choosing extraction methods in order to avoid the liberation of fatty acids from non-living organic material and deposits, and to exclude the non-target selection of lipids from living organisms, as well. By excluding the fatty acids which were presumed to be common and widespread prior to multivariate statistical analysis, estimates were improved considerably. Results from principal component analysis showed that determining the levels of fatty acids present in both low and high concentrations is essential in order to correctly identify microorganisms and accurately classify them into taxonomically defined groups. The PLFA technique has been used to elucidate different strategies employed by microorganisms to adapt to changed environmental conditions under wide ranges of soil types, management practices, climatic origins and different perturbations. It has been proposed that the classification of PLFAs into a number of chemically different subgroups should simplify the evaluating procedure and improve the assessment of soil microbial communities, since then only the subgroups assumed to be involved in key processes would be investigated.},

Microbial communities in the rhizosphere are crucial to nutrient and organic matter cycling within agroecosystems. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of crop management on microbial community structure and processing of rhizodeposit-C within microenvironments of two soil zones, the rhizosphere versus non-rhizosphere.MethodsNew root-C (Cnew) from 13C-labeled hairy vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) plants were traced into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) within microaggregate (53–250 μm) and silt-and-clay ({\textless}53 μm) microenvironments in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil during the cover crop growing season in long-term conventional (annual synthetic fertilizer applications), low-input (synthetic fertilizer and cover crop applied in alternating years), and organic (annual composted manure and cover crop additions) maize-tomato systems (Zea mays L.- Lycopersicum esculentum L.).ResultsAmong the three cropping systems, the composition of the microbial communities processing root-derived C were similar, which implied that the cropping systems maintained diverse microbial communities that were capable of utilizing similar C substrates despite receiving different long-term nutrient inputs. Relative distributions of root-derived PLFA-C (13C mol\%) in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere were not significantly different, thereby suggesting that the structure of the microbial community utilizing new root-C in the rhizosphere- and non-rhizosphere microenvironments were similar. However, total PLFA biomass was four times greater, and root-derived PLFA-C in both soil microenvironments were approximately 10 times greater in the rhizosphere than in the non-rhizosphere. Although no microbial group dominated the processing of Cnew in the microenvironments of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere, we found that the microbial community of the silt-and-clay in the rhizosphere played a different role in the cycling of Cnew compared to communities in the rhizosphere microaggregates and those in the silt-and-clay and microaggregates of the non-rhizosphere.ConclusionsOur results confirm that rhizodeposition plays an important role in the greater contribution of root-C than residue-C to SOM stabilization. This study also showed that microbial communities assimilating rhizodeposit-C are sensitive to their microenvironment (i.e., microaggregates versus silt-and-clay particles); nevertheless, differences in long-term crop management did not lead to differences in the capacity of the microbial communities to utilize active cover crop root-C substrates.},

On a 6 year old set-aside arable land rhizosphere soil samples were taken under Agropyron repens, Cirsium arvense and Rumex acetosa, the most frequent plant species, and under the leguminous plant species Vicia villosa. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) has been used to characterise the structure of the soil microbial community. Carbon mineralisation rates as well as gross (15N isotope pool dilution method) and net nitrogen mineralisation rates were determined as indicator of microbial activity. In intensive managed plots a rhizosphere effect was obvious in higher nutrient contents, gross N mineralisation rates and higher relative abundances of fungi and protozoa in Rye rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Plant species altered rhizosphere microbial activity. Lowest gross N mineralisation and gross NH4 consumption rates were detected in Rye rhizosphere soil. Both rates revealed high positive correlations with dissolved organic carbon (extracted with KCl) and soil pH. The rhizosphere soil microbial communities of the three dominant plant species of the set-aside arable land (Agropyron, Cirsium, Rumex) were more similar to each other than to Vicia grown on the same set-aside plots and Rye grown on intensive managed plots. The highest number of non-identified PLFAs detected in Vicia rhizosphere soil suggests that microbial diversity was highest. Differences in quantity and quality of Vicia rhizodeposition, especially higher N contents, seem to induce the higher microbial activity and different microbial community structure. The rhizosphere soil of the dominant plant species on the set-aside and intensively managed arable land reflected the differences in bulk soil properties (obtained in a previous study) between the two management systems (e.g. pH, gross N mineralisation, metabolic quotient, PLFA marker characteristic of G− bacteria and fungi).},

	abstract = {Many world ecosystems are in various states of decline evidenced by erosion, low productivity, and poor water quality caused by forest clearing, intensive agricultural production, and continued use of land resources for purposes that are not sustainable. The biological diversity of these systems is being altered. Little research has been conducted to quantify the beneficial relationships between microbial diversity, soil and plant quality, and ecosystem sustainability. Ecosystem functioning is governed largely by soil microbial dynamics. Differences in microbial properties and activities of soils have been reported but are restricted to general ecological enumeration methods or activity levels, which are limited in their ability to describe a particular ecosystem. Microbial populations and their responses to stresses have been traditionally studied at the process level, in terms of total numbers of microorganisms, biomass, respiration rates, and enzyme activities, with little attention being paid to responses at the community or the organismal levels. These process level measurements, although critical to understanding the ecosystem, may be insensitive to community level changes due to the redundancy of these functions. As microbial communities comprise complex interactions between diverse organisms, they should be studied as such, and not as a “black box” into which inputs are entered and outputs are received at measured rates. Microbial communities and their processes need to be examined in relation to not only the individuals that comprise the community, but the effect of perturbations or environmental stresses on those communities.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve sustainability in managed ecosystems we must understand management impacts on soil processes and clarify the regulatory role of the microbial community on these processes. Crop rotation and organic management practices are thought to have positive impacts on the microbial biomass; however, the specific impacts of crop rotation organic management on soil microbial ecology are largely unknown. The effect of organic management on soil microbial ecology was investigated using soils collected from the Rodale Institute Research Center's long-term Farming Systems Trial (FST) experiment. The FST, begun in 1981, included a manured and a cover cropped organic rotation and a conventionally managed grain based rotation. Soil respiration rates and13C-isotope fate in a companion study suggest that the biomass characteristics of the FST treatment soils were different in November 1991. However, direct measurement of the microbial community at this time using Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA) did not identify statistically significant treatment based differences in soil biomass characteristics. Variability among the PLFA profiles of treatment replicates was as great as variability between farming systems. Treatment based trends were observed among selected PLFAs, particularly those present in large amounts, that were consistent with indirect biomass and biomass-dependent measures. Overall, PLFA profiles, soil respiration rates and13C-cycling suggested that the organic cover cropped soil had the Largest and most heterogeneous microbial population while the biomass of the organic-manure amended soil was the least heterogeneous, and the most metabolically active.},

	abstract = {Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were measured in soils from organic, low-input, and conventional farming systems that are part of the long term Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project. The farming systems differ in whether their source of fertilizer is mineral or organic, and in whether a winter cover crop is grown. Sustained increases in microbial biomass resulting from high organic matter inputs have been observed in the organic and low-input systems. PLFA profiles were compared to ascertain whether previously observed changes in biomass were accompanied by a change in the composition of the microbial community. In addition, the relative importance of environmental variables on PLFA profiles was determined. Redundancy analysis ordination showed that PLFA profiles from organic and conventional systems were significantly different from April to July. On ordination plots, PLFA profiles from the low-input system fell between organic and conventional systems on most sample dates. A group of fatty acids (i14:0, a15:0, 16:1ω7c, 16:1ω5c, 14:0, and 18:2ω6c) was enriched in the organic plots throughout the sampling period, and another group (10Me16:0, 2OH 16:1 and 10Me17:0) was consistently lower in relative abundance in the organic system. In addition, another group (15:0, a17:0, i16:0, 17:0, and 10Me18:0) was enriched over the short term in the organic plots after compost incorporation. The relative importance of various environmental variables in governing the composition of microbial communities could be ranked in the order: soil type {\textgreater} time {\textgreater} specific farming operation (e.g., cover crop incorporation or sidedressing with mineral fertilizer) {\textgreater} management system {\textgreater} spatial variation in the field. Measures of the microbial community and soil properties (including microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, substrate induced respiration, basal respiration, potentially mineralizable nitrogen, soil nitrate and ammonium, and soil moisture) were seldom associated with the variation in the PLFA profiles.},

In this study, soils were collected from research plots over 2 years and from commercial grower fields over 1 year. Treatments at the sites included 1–9 years of either winter cover cropping or winter fallow practices. Soils were assayed for microbial fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), direct count microscopy and Biolog substrate utilization potentials to assess management and environmental influences on soil communities. The strongest influence was season. Soils in early spring (prior to termination of the cover crop) utilized fewer carboxylic acids and generally were enriched in eukaryotic FAMEs, whereas proportionally more bacterial FAMEs were detected in soils at canopy closure and harvest of the summer vegetable crop. Within a season, community FAME and Biolog patterns were related to field properties. FAME profiles from grower fields in early spring and harvest were correlated significantly with soil texture, cation exchange capacity, and carbon content. Changes in community structure and Biolog potential occurred in some soils in response to winter cover crops, although effects were not observed until cover crop incorporation. Greater amounts of fungal and protozoan FAME markers were detected in some cover-cropped soils compared to winter fallow soils. Cover crop residues increased FAME diversity at one research station and Biolog diversity at two research stations and the grower fields. Although seasonal and field-dependent factors are major determinants of microbial community structure, shifts can occur as soil physical and chemical properties change in response to alternative practices, as demonstrated by this study.},

All three techniques showed that the rhizosphere bacterial community differed from the bulk soil community, when pea plants were grown in pots. The two PLFA techniques also indicated that the effect of roots on microbial communities was greater than differences in the PLFA pattern between different bulk soils. The difference was most prominent using the direct soil–PLFA technique. Both PLFA techniques indicated that gram-negative bacteria were relatively more abundant in the rhizosphere, while PLFAs indicative of gram-positive bacteria were relatively more common in bulk soil samples. The results obtained with the direct soil–PLFA method did not differ between rhizosphere samples taken along a pea root, while this was the case with both the cfu–PLFA technique and the CLPP method. According to both techniques, the differences in community composition were greatest near the root tip. Different plant species exhibited different microbial community composition in the rhizosphere, as judged from all three methods, when four different plant species were compared. In all cases, Trifolium differed most from the other species (three different grasses). Although all three methods were found to be suitable for rhizosphere studies, the CLPP method appeared less suitable than the two PLFA methods, since less of the variation in the data could usually be explained.},

	abstract = {Two sandstone-derived soils under pure stands of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were studied to determine if the fine earth (\&lt;2 mm material) and two size-classes of porous rock fragments (\&gt;2 mm material) supported different microbial communities. Samples from three soil horizons (A, Bw, and BC) were analysed under both optical and scanning electron microscopes. Small stones (2–10 mm in average diameter) appeared more altered than larger ones (40–60 mm) and the effects of weathering became more obvious with shallower depth. In both soils, numerous hyphae and other living forms were observed on the surface of the stones from the A and Bw horizons; this contrasted with the stones from the BC horizon, which showed little or no colonisation. The microbial community of each fraction was characterised using Biolog-Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) and phospholipid fatty acid analyses (PLFA) for samples in the A and B horizons. Significant potential microbial activity (C source utilisation) was associated with rock fragments, from the A horizon and, to a lesser extent, the B, although this was lower than for the equivalent fine earth fraction. The microbial colonisation of the stones appeared inversely related with their size and sampling depth. The PLFA analysis showed not only quantitative differences in the microbial biomass between horizons and size-fractions but also highlighted that the communities differed between soils, horizons (for the sole beech soil) and fractions. These findings demonstrate that by considering rock fragments as a microbiologically inert fraction and discarding them before analysis, as usually is done, can lead to an incomplete picture of both the total amount and, perhaps more importantly, the structure of soil microbial community.},

We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer’s fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index. Visual soil evaluation techniques also provide a useful visual aid for improving soil awareness in groups of stakeholders, helping the exchange of knowledge and ideas for innovation in agriculture.},

	abstract = {Crop residue addition is a way to increase soil organic matter (SOM) level in croplands. However, organic matter input and SOM stocks are not linearly related. Consequently, adding high amounts of residues, such as straw, may increase SOM to only a small extent, and an alternative use of the residues may be justified. The objective of this study was to test how the level and type (above- or belowground) of residue addition affect SOM stabilization. We hypothesise that (1) root residues will be mineralised slower than leaf and stalk residues, (2) soil aggregate formation will increase with high additions, and (3) wheat residue addition will induce positive priming, with the magnitude depending on the residue level and type. Homogeneously 13C-labelled wheat residues (leaves, stalks, roots) were added to a silt-loam soil at levels of 1.40 and 5.04 g DM kg− 1 and CO2 release and δ13C signature were measured over 64 days at 20 °C. Water-stable macroaggregates (\&gt; 250 μm), microaggregates (53–250 μm) and silt plus clay size fractions (\&lt; 53 μm) were separated and 13C incorporation from residue was quantified in each fraction after 64 days. Aggregate formation generally increased with added residue amount, but the proportion of residues occluded within aggregates decreased with increasing addition level. The occlusion of residues from aboveground biomass was more reduced with addition level than that of roots. Residue mineralisation increased with the addition level, but this increase was less for roots compared to stalks and leaves. Priming effects were similar between residue types and mainly depended on the added amount: SOM mineralisation increased by 50\% and 90\% at low and high addition levels, respectively. We conclude that the proportion of residues physically protected within aggregates decreases and priming effects increase with increasing C input leading to decreasing rate of long-term C stabilization within SOM by increasing residue addition.},

Surface broadcast and/or banded nutrient applications may result in high and low fertility zones in permanent NT, with possible implications for soil sampling and nutrient placement. We investigated effects of 25 years of continuous NT, CD and MD with corn planted in the same row locations on organic matter (SOM), pH-H2O and Mehlich-3 extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Vertical distribution at 0–5, 5–10 and 10–15 cm depths was measured as well as horizontal distributions across corn rows. We observed higher SOM and P in NT and CD than in MD in the 0–15 cm layer. SOM content was greatest in the top 5 cm in NT, but declined sharply with depth. SOM content in CD was not as high at the surface as in NT, but did not decline as fast as in NT. SOM was uniform but low throughout the 0–15 cm depth of MD. In all tillage systems, SOM did not vary across rows. Soil pH was higher in the 0–5 cm layer of NT than the deeper layers but the reverse was true in the CD or MD treatments. Concentrations of P, K and Ca were higher in the surface 0–5 cm than 10–15 cm depth of all tillage systems, but most strikingly in NT and CD. Starter fertilizer injection resulted in higher P and lower pH in the injection zone of all tillage treatments, but most notably in NT. The pH was depressed under the band of side-dressed nitrogen with all tillage systems. Potassium accumulated in the rows of the previous crop, probably because it leached from crop residue that accumulated there. Tillage did not affect Mg distribution. Optimal nutrient management in NT should take account of horizontal and vertical nutrient and pH distributions. Samples in long-term NT could potentially be taken to a shallower depth if calibration curves are available. To avoid underestimating P and K availability or overestimate lime needs, high P or decreased pH bands should be avoided, as well as crop rows. Possibilities to reduce P and K applications with banding need more investigation. Results show the importance of regular liming in NT to maintain surface pH in the optimum range, but also show that lime does not have to be incorporated.},

	abstract = {Much of the biodiversity of agroecosystems lies in the soil. The functions performed by soil biota have major direct and indirect effects on crop growth and quality, soil and residue-borne pests, diseases incidence, the quality of nutrient cycling and water transfer, and, thus, on the sustainability of crop management systems. Farmers use tillage, consciously or inadvertently, to manage soil biodiversity. Given the importance of soil biota, one of the key challenges in tillage research is understanding and predicting the effects of tillage on soil ecology, not only for assessments of the impact of tillage on soil organisms and functions, but also for the design of tillage systems to make the best use of soil biodiversity, particularly for crop protection. In this paper, we first address the complexity of soil ecosystems, the descriptions of which vary between studies, in terms of the size of organisms, the structure of food webs and functions. We then examine the impact of tillage on various groups of soil biota, outlining, through examples, the crucial effects of tillage on population dynamics and species diversity. Finally, we tackle the question of the design of tillage systems to enhance biological control in cultivated fields. Identification of the optimal tillage system requires a global consideration of soil management, rather than an analysis focusing on tillage alone, taking into account soil ecology. Organic residue management, the prevention of compaction, crop rotation and the timing of cultivation must all be considered together, taking into account their impact on pest populations and on the natural enemies of pests and ecosystem engineers. This approach requires more detailed research and careful experimental design than traditional comparisons of conventional and reduced tillage systems. We propose the development of population modeling in cultivated fields, as the available ecological models rarely include parameters linked to the soil management system.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term (less than 2 years) conservation managements [no-tillage (NT) and crop residue returning] on top soil (0–5 cm) microbial community composition and soil organic C (SOC) fractions under a rice-wheat rotation at Junchuan town of Hubei Province, China. Treatments were established following a split-plot design of a randomized complete block with tillage practices [conventional tillage (CT) and NT] as the main plot and residue returning level [no residue returning (0) and all residues returned to fields from the preceding crop (S, 2,146 kg C ha−1)] as the subplots. The four treatments were CT with or without residue returning (CT0 and CTS) and NT with or without residue returning (NT0 and NTS). The abundances of microbial groups [total FLFAs, fungal biomass, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass/bacterial biomass (F/B), monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), and microbial stress] were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis of soil. The ratio of MUFA/STFA reflects aeration of soil and greater MUFA/STFA means better aeration condition of soil. Moreover, the microbial stress, the ratio of cy19:0 to 18:1ω7, was regarded as an indicator of physiological or nutritional stress of microbial community. PLFA profiles were dominated by the fatty acids iC15:0 (9.8 \%), C16:0 (16.5 \%), 10Me17:0 (9.9 \%), and Cyc19:0 (8.3 \%), together accounting for 44.6 \% of the total PLFAs. Compared with CT, NT significantly increased microbial biomass C (MBC) by 20.0 \% but did not affect concentrations of total organic C (TOC), dissolved organic C (DOC), easily oxidizable C (EOC), and SOC of aggregates. Residue returning significantly increased MBC by 18.3 \% and SOC content of 2–1-mm aggregate by 9.4 \%. NT significantly increased total PLFAs by 9.8 \% and fungal biomass by 40.8 \% but decreased MUFA/STFA by 15.5 \%. Residue returning significantly enhanced total PLFAs, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass, F/B, and MUFA/STFA by 31.1, 36.0, 95.9, 42.5, and 58.8 \%, respectively, but decreased microbial stress by 45.9 \%. Multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis and partial correlation analysis) indicated that SOC of 2–1-mm aggregate was related to changes in the composition of soil microbial groups, suggesting that SOC of 2–1-mm aggregate was sensitive to changes in soil microbial community composition affected by short-term conservation management practices in our study.},

Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimetres. Biologic influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of aggregates but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies which create aggregations of particles and those which stabilize or degrade such aggregations.

The formation of soil structure involves the physical forces of shrinking and swelling created by changes in water status of soils, freezing and thawing, tillage, or by movement of the larger biota in soils. Expansive properties of soils are controlled by the clay content. Thus changes of structural organisation are minimal in sands and maximal in clays. Plant roots, earthworms and other macrofauna large enough to move soil particles create pores recognisable by cylindrical shapes and smooth curved surfaces. Various visual and microscopic techniques aided by dyes are available to demonstrate the extent of biovoids in soils.

Biology plays a major role in stabilization of soil structure. The major factors vary depending on the scale of soil structure. At larger scales plant roots and associated hyphae can be seen to enmesh soil particles by acting as a “sticky string bag”. At the microscale the influence of mucilages from roots, hyphae, bacteria and fauna such as earthworms can be shown by a range of microscopic techniques to be involved in stabilizing smaller aggregates and the linings of biopores. Techniques include optical and fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy including EDAX, transmission electron microscopy using heavy metals or other electron dense staining techniques for specific chemical compounds, and computer aided tomography. The microscopic techniques can be used on individual aggregates, stabilized soils, sections or separates of soils.

Both microflora and fauna are involved in the degradation of stabilizing agents. Fauna may comminute roots and hyphae which stabilized larger aggregates and microorganisms utilize mucilaginous stabilizing agents as an energy source resulting in a slow breakdown of structural stability. Such effects can be established by combinations of studies of aggregation including microscopy. Further destruction of structure is caused by tillage and compaction by vehicles and animals.},

Soil bulk density was measured using a nuclear gauge pre-harvest and post-harvest systematically across the harvest unit and on transects across skid trails. Bulk density also was measured in the skid trails in a subset of the transects after the first 10 loaded machine passes. Post-harvest soil bulk density of 954.4 kg/m³ was not significantly different from the pre-harvest bulk density of 925.2 kg/m³ across the site. Grapple skidding resulted in significant bulk density changes in the skid trails. Results suggest that most of the soil bulk density changes in the skid trails occurred after the first loaded machine pass. Our findings suggest that the use of tracked feller-bunchers to fell and bunch the trees results in the minimum changes to soil bulk density across a harvest site.},

The magnitude of the change varies according to the soil property, the climate, and the type and time of implementation of a particular management system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of no-tillage (NT) on the chemical and biological properties of an Entic Haploxeroll in Central Chile. Soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass and associated indicators q CO 2 , qMic, qMin, available N, P and K, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and crop yield were determined in a field experiment having a wheat (Triticum turgidum L.)–maize (Zea mays L.) crop rotation. The change in soil chemical properties was further evaluated using a greenhouse bioassay in which ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in soil samples extracted at 0–2, 2–5, and 5–15 cm depth. After nine years SOC in the NT treatment was 29.7 Mg ha−1 compared to 24.8 Mg ha−1 of CT, resulting in 4.98 Mg ha−1 C gain. The NT therefore resulted in an average annual sequestration of 0.55 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the upper 15 cm soil. The soil organic C stored under NT was mainly accumulated in the top 2-cm of soil. The biological indicators showed a greater biological soil quality under NT than under CT. Soil organic C was positively associated with available N, P, and K, but negatively with soil pH. The ryegrass bioassay yielded higher biomass in NT than CT. An improvement in the soil chemical quality of the NT soil was considered to be the main reason for this result. The maize yield under NT had the tendency to improve in time as compared to CT. Wheat, however, had lower yield under NT. It was concluded that NT increased C sequestration and SOC improving the chemical and biological properties of this soil.},

	abstract = {New non-tillage or reduced tillage agricultural practises are being increasingly adopted but generally result in higher soil compaction. Due to their recognised physical influence mainly through burrow creation, it is often claimed that earthworm activity could alleviate soil compaction in these systems. To put this assumption to the test, an experimental compaction event was carried out on one plot of arable land. The abundance and biomass of earthworms were evaluated in compacted (under wheel tracks) and non-compacted (between wheel tracks) zones, seven times over a two-year period. In addition, the functional consequences of earthworm activity, defined by burrow abundance assessed in 2D and 3D and water infiltration, were measured three times over the same period. The short-term (less than three months) effects of the compaction were clear: soil bulk density increased from 1.46 to 1.57 g cm−3, the abundance and biomass of earthworms were greatly reduced (−40\% and −70\% respectively) and the number and continuity of macroporosity were lower under wheel tracks at least until a depth of 30 cm. After these initial detrimental effects, we observed a rapid recovery of earthworm populations with no statistical difference between compacted and control zones more than three months after the compaction. However, the recovery of soil functional properties linked to earthworm activity, macroporosity and water infiltration, was much slower and took between 12 and 24 months. Despite these modifications, there were no significant changes in soil bulk density with time during the two-year period. This study demonstrates that earthworms are important actors in the regeneration of compacted soil. Although the complete regeneration of compacted soil by earthworms is a slow process, agricultural practises that promote earthworm density and activity should be encouraged in reduced or minimum tillage systems.},

It discusses in the context of the current situation, the causes, identification, effects and alleviation of compaction. The principal causes are when compressive forces derived from wheels, tillage machinery and from the trampling of animals, act on compressible soil. Compact soils can also be found under natural conditions without human or animal involvement. Compaction alters many soil properties and adverse effects are mostly linked to a reduction in permeability to air, water and roots. Many methods can be used to measure the changes. In practical situations, the use of visual and tactile methods directly in the field is recommended. The worst problems tend to occur when root crops and vegetables are harvested from soils at or wetter than field capacity. As discussed by a farmer, the effects on crop uniformity and quality (as well as a reduction in yield) can be marked. By contrast, rendzinas and other calcareous soils growing mainly cereals are comparatively free of compaction problems. The effect of a given level of compaction is related to both weather and climate; where soil moisture deficits are large, a restriction in root depth may have severe effects but the same level of compaction may have a negligible effect where moisture deficits are small. Topsoil compaction in sloping landscapes enhances runoff and may induce erosion particularly along wheeltracks, with consequent off-farm environmental impacts. Indirect effects of compaction include denitrification which is likely to lead to nitrogen deficiency in crops. The effects of heavy tractors and harvesters can to some extent be compensated for by a reduction in tyre pressures although there is concern that deep-seated compaction may occur. Techniques for loosening compaction up to depths of 45 cm are well established but to correct deeper problems presents difficulties. Several authors recommend that monitoring of soil physical conditions, including compaction, should be part of routine soil management.},

Total organochlorine phytoextraction by ssp. pepo increased at least 25\% in the presence of any of the earthworm species (relative to plants grown in isolation). Uptake of the compound by ssp. ovifera was unaffected by earthworms. Plants influenced earthworm bioaccumulation as well. When combined with pepo, p,p′-DDE levels in E. fetida decreased by 50\%, whereas, in the presence of ovifera, bioconcentration by L. terrestris increased by more than 2-fold. Spectral analysis indicated a decrease in hydrophobicity of HA in each of the soils in which both pepo and earthworms were present. However, HA chemistry from ovifera treatments was largely unaffected by earthworms. Risk assessments of contaminated soils should account for species interactions, and SOM chemistry may be a useful indictor of pollutant bioaccumulation.},

	abstract = {Conservation tillage practices that entail no or reduced soil disturbance are known to help preserve or accumulate soil organic matter (OM). However, the underlying mechanisms especially at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study soil samples from 25-year-old experimental plots continuously cropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under no-tillage (NT) and chisel tillage (CT) were subjected to a new physical fractionation method to isolate dissolved OM, mineral-free particulate OM located outside aggregates (physically and chemically unprotected), OM occluded within both macroaggregates and microaggregates (weakly and strongly protected by physical mechanisms, respectively), and OM in intimate association with minerals (protected by chemical mechanisms). The whole soils and OM fractions were analyzed for organic C and N content and by modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The soil under NT stored 16\% more organic C and 5\% more N than the soil under CT. Compared to CT, NT increased free organic C content by 7\%, intra-macroaggregate organic C content by 20\%, intra-microaggregate organic C content by 63\%, and mineral-associated organic C content by 16\% and decreased dissolved organic C content by 11\%. The mineral-associated OM pool accounted for 65\% of the difference in total organic C content between NT and CT, whereas the intra-microaggregate OM only explained 18\%, intra-macroaggregate OM 14\%, and free OM 11\%. The NMR experiments revealed that the free and intra-aggregate OM fractions were dominated by crop-derived materials at different stages of decomposition, whereas the mineral-associated OM pool was predominately of microbial origin. Overall, our results indicate that microbes and microbial by-products associated with mineral surfaces and likely physically protected by entrapment within very small microaggregates constitute the most important pool of OM stabilization and C sequestration in soils under NT. Most probably the slower macroaggregate turnover in NT relative to CT boosts not only the formation of microaggregates and thereby the physical protection of crop-derived particulate OM, but more importantly the interaction between mineral particles and microbial material that results in the formation of very stable organo-mineral complexes.},

	abstract = {The shallow soils of Pianosa—a small calcareous island in the Mediterranean Sea, facing Tuscany, central Italy—developed under the same pedogenic factors with the exception of vegetation and, in the last two centuries, human impact. Originally, they were covered by “macchia,” a tangled mix of bushy species, or, in a few more fertile sites, by Quercus ilex L. Currently there are six land uses on the island: (1) pristine macchia, (2) groves of Olea europaea L. totally reinvaded by macchia, (3) degraded residual thickets of Q. ilex, (4) cropland, (5) recently abandoned pastures, and (6) stands of Pinus halepensis Mill. The related soils were analysed by solid-state cross polarisation/magic angle spinning 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to compare the spectroscopic properties of their organic pool. The prevalence of O-alkyl C over other C forms is evident in all cases, while there is large variability with respect to the alkyl C to aromatic C ratio between both the different soils, and the horizons of a same soil. On the whole, the results show that on Pianosa Island, human impact has profoundly altered not only the amount but also the quality of soil organic matter (SOM). The SOM residual of the dichromate oxidation in the Walkley–Black method—a widely used method to measure soil organic C—was also analysed by NMR. It comprised almost exclusively alkyl C and aromatic C, as a result of the removal of carbonyl and O-alkyl C. Most of the aromatic C seems to belong to charcoal.},

of soil samples taken at depths of 0-15 cm, two
years after the start of the experiments. In the minimum
tillage system, the respiratory activity, metabolic
quotient, mineralization index and phosphatase activity
were higher than those of the other tillage systems,
while a higher biomass value was found in the
ripper subsoiling system. The higher concentration of
crop residues in the surface layer and less alteration
to the soil structure, inherent in minimum tillage'
caused an increase in microbial metabolic activities.
Coxcr,ustoxs. After two yearc of using alternative
tillage systems, minimum tillage was revealed as particularly
favourable towards the development of rnicrobial
metabolic activities at depths of 0-15 cm, although
it did not influence the conservation of organic

	abstract = {Although reduced tillage is an agricultural practice reported to decrease soil erosion and external inputs while enhancing soil fertility, it has still rarely been adopted by European organic farmers. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term interactive effects of tillage (conventional (CT) vs. reduced (RT)) and fertilization (slurry (S) vs. composted manure/slurry (MCS)) on earthworms and microbial communities in a clay soil under spelt in an organic 6-year crop rotation. Earthworm populations (species, density and biomass, cocoons) were investigated by handsorting the soil nine years after initial implementation of the treatments. Soil microbial carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) were measured by chloroform-fumigation extraction and a simplified phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to separate for populations of bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Significantly increased total earthworm density in RT plots was mainly attributed to increased numbers of juveniles. Moreover, we found five times more cocoons with RT. Species richness was not affected by the treatments, but tillage treatments had differentially affected populations at the species-level. In addition, cluster analysis at the community level revealed two distinct groups of plots in relation to tillage treatments. In RT plots Cmic increased in the 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm soil layers, while PLFA concentrations indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa only increased in the topsoil. Lower bacteria-to-fungi ratios in the upper soil layer of RT plots indicated a shift to fungal-based decomposition of organic matter whereas a higher Cmic-to-Corg ratio pointed towards enhanced substrate availability. Slurry application decreased microbial biomass and enhanced density of juvenile anecic earthworms but overall fertilization effect was weak and no interactions with tillage were found. In conclusion, tillage is a major driver in altering communities of earthworms and microorganisms in arable soils. The use of reduced tillage provides an approach for eco-intensification by enhancing inherent soil biota functions under organic arable farming.},

	abstract = {In France, agronomists have studied the effects of cropping systems on soil structure using a field method based on a morphological description of soil structure. In this method, called “profil cultural” or soil profile in English, the soil structure of the tilled layer is observed on a vertical face of a pit. Subsoil and more especially the transition layer between topsoil and subsoil have not always been given specific consideration. However, these layers undergo the effect of cropping systems through soil compaction or smoothing/smearing. A more accurate quantification of earthworm macropores and cracks in the transition layer would enable a more precise evaluation of the agronomical potential of the soil, manifest in root development or water retention. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present the profil cultural method in detail, along with the improvements we have made to quantify the ability of roots to penetrate compacted zones in the transition layer. We propose two indicators: (i) number of earthworm burrows per m2 counted on a horizontal surface at the bottom of the transition layer in the soil pit (ii) cracking quantified by taking a 50-mm × 50-mm × 100-mm sample of soil from the transition layer and examining the number of cracks. Results from experiments on different tillage treatments are used to demonstrate why it is worthwhile to take into account cracks and earthworm activity. Soil profiles were examined in mouldboard ploughed and no tillage fields, and described using the profil cultural method and the new indicators. Root maps were also traced to observe the effect of soil structure on root growth. Preliminary results show that the classification of cracking and the quantification of the number of earthworm burrows per m2 can explain observed root development in subsoil. This first approach towards a better observation of subsoil structure and the effect it has on roots needs to be confirmed through further research, and especially via quantification and scoring of soil structure impact on roots.},

	abstract = {This work is concerned with the effect of five earthworm species on short-term soil dynamics through carbon (C) mineralisation and large soil aggregate characteristics (production, stability, organic matter content and composition) in laboratory experiments. We hypothesised that the influence of earthworms on soil behaviour depends on individual species and land use history. Substrates were a sequence of three similar luvisols that had been subjected to different land use histories and represented increasing C contents from 10 mg kg−1 (cropped soil), to 20 mg kg−1 (5-year-old pasture soil) and 33 mg kg−1 (permanent pasture soil). We found that relative C mineralisation was slower in pasture than in cropped soils, which can be explained by differences in the physical protection of soil organic matter (SOM). Land use history influenced (i) the amount of large macro-aggregate production through earthworm behaviour (casting activity), and (ii) the size distribution of water stable soil fractions within the large macro-aggregate produced. No effect of earthworm species on SOM composition was observed with near infrared spectrometry indicating that the chemistry of large macro-aggregates was mainly driven by land use type. Earthworm species had more pronounced effects on physical (large aggregate production and stability) than on biological (C mineralisation promotion) or biochemical (SOM composition) features. This paper shows that, although earthworm effects on soil processes are now obvious, a number of factors may interact in such complex systems so that we should hesitate to make generalisations.},

In that region, there is evidence of soil fertility decline which is attributed to past crop management practices. The questions addressed in this article are first, whether components of soil fertility can be improved by better management and second, by how much soil fertility would change. Soil fertility for crop production is considered in terms of soil organic carbon and nitrogen. A stochastic dynamic economic analysis of soil fertility management for wheat production is presented. A sequential analysis of first deriving the optimal nitrogen stock and application rates is followed by an assessment of tillage, stubble, and fertilizer strategies to obtain an optimal level of soil organic carbon. The recommended management practices are consistent with emerging management trends in the region. The derivation of optimal levels of soil fertility for agricultural purposes has other policy implications, which we discuss.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify pore characteristics (quantity, distribution, stability and orientation of pores) that condition water dynamics under continuous zero tillage (ZT) on silty soils of the Argentinian Rolling Pampas. Soil properties were analyzed under continuous chisel plough (CP) and ZT treatments from three trials with different duration and crop sequence. The following soil properties of A horizon were analyzed from 0 to 0.05 and from 0.10 to 0.15 m depths: bulk density, pore size distribution, pore origin distribution, aggregate stability index, infiltration rate and organic matter. Preferred pore orientation was carried out by introducing the sampling cylinders in vertical and horizontal direction and then discriminating by pore size. Total porosity of A horizon under CP was 3.5\% higher than under ZT. This could be attributed to macro and mesopores as well as to structural porosity. Aggregates were 30\% more stable in ZT than under CP in the top at 0.05 m due to a 21\% increase in organic matter. However, infiltration rate was not improved under ZT. Under ZT, there was a tendency of macropores to become orientated in parallel to the soil surface. This horizontal preferential macropore orientation was critical in determining water infiltration. The susceptibility to stratify the structure in the first centimeters of the soil under ZT was attributed to the predominance of soybean in the crop sequence.},

	abstract = {Long-term studies are crucial for quantifying tillage effects on productivity and soil fertility. Moldboard plow, chisel plow, spring disk, ridge-tillage, and no-tillage systems were evaluated after 32 years of a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and 27 years of continuous corn in central Iowa, U.S.A. Productivity was quantified using yield, while soil fertility status was evaluated by collecting four, 5-cm diameter soil cores to a depth of 0.9 m from each treatment, dividing them into four depth increments (0–15-, 15–30-, 30–60-, and 60–90-cm), analyzing them for bulk density (BD), NO3-N, NH4-N, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Mehlich-3 extractable P, K, Ca, Mg and DTPA-extractable Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, and interpreting the data using Iowa State University (ISU) guidelines. Production costs for each tillage and cropping system were also computed. To account for genetic and agronomic changes during the 30-year study period, yields were examined for establishment, maintenance, and intensification/recovery phases. Rotated corn yield averaged 8.6, 8.8, and 11.6 Mg ha−1 and soybean yield averaged 2.7, 3.2, and 3.4 Mg ha−1, respectively, for each of the phases. Continuous corn from 1988 to 2006 averaged 7.5 and 10.1 Mg ha−1 for the maintenance and intensification/recovery phases, respectively. Fixed plus variable machinery costs for corn ranged from 233 to 354 USD ha−1, while for soybean they ranged from 194 to 280 USD ha−1. Net returns to land, labor and management ranged from 233 to 269, 560 to 620, and 437 to 483 USD ha−1 for continuous corn, rotated corn, and rotated soybean, respectively. Based on 9-year (2003–2011) average grain prices and yields from this study, the corn–soybean rotation was twice as profitable as continuous corn. Soil-test P and K measurements, as well as calculated P and K removal, suggest that nutrient mining occurred during the course of this study. The soil-test data also indicate that further studies are needed regarding plant availability of subsoil K and its impact on fertilizer recommendations. Overall, we conclude that with good nutrient management and crop rotation, yield and soil fertility differences between no-tillage and more intensive tillage systems can be minimized and that no-till production can be profitable on glacial till derived soils.},

To predict Db as functions of the measurements of CI and θ, a variety of semi-empirical CI-models have been established historically, however a study for validating these models has not been found. In this study four CI-models, one considered the penetration depth as variable but others did not, were evaluated under laboratory condition. The methodology was to use our own developed dual-sensor vertical penetrometer (DSVP) to simultaneously measure CI and volumetric soil water content (θv), and then to compare the bulk density (Db) core-measured to that model-predicted by the DSVP data. Two types of soil samples (silt-loam and clay) were tested. Because a previous study speculated that penetration depth could confound the CI measured, two depth-dependent factors were incorporated into each CI-model for validating this speculation. Our study found that two of the four models tested fit the experimental data with acceptable R2 (\&gt;0.70) and RMSE (\&lt;0.093 g cm−3). In contrast, the experimental results confirmed that CI in Model-1 had a peak value adapting a wide range of θ. More ever, the results indicated that the DSVP combined with Model-1 or Model-2 can be used as a tool to predict Db when CI and θ are simultaneously measured.},

The incorporation of M enhanced the rate of both heterotrophic degradation of glycine and subsequent autotrophic nitrification in direct relation to the amounts of M added. In soil amended with K, neither degradation nor nitrification was stimulated. The addition of M shortened the lag phase before nitrification was initiated, increased the pH of both the soil and the perfusates, and increased the rate, but not the extent, of oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. The addition of CaCO3 or MgCO3, but not of CaSO4, also enhanced the rate of nitrification.

	abstract = {Several soils subject to different cultivation and management practices were examined by analysis of fatty acid profiles derived from phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides, using an improved sequential method which is capable of measuring ester-linked and non-ester-linked phospholipid fatty acids (EL-PLFA, NEL-PLFA, respectively) and the hydroxy fatty acids in lipopolysaccharides. A good correlation was obtained (r{\textgreater}0.90) between the soil biomass and total EL-PLFA in the soils investigated, which ranged from forest soils to a variety of agricultural soils. Elucidation of the composition of the community structure was an additional task. Eukaryotes can be differentiated from bacteria by the presence of polyunsaturated and ω-hydroxy fatty acids, both of which were much more abundant in the OF layer of the forest soil than in the remaining samples. A relatively low proportion of monomethyl branched-chain saturated fatty acids was obtained in the forest OF horizon, these being indicators for Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes. Various subclasses of proteobacteria produce β and mid-chain hydroxy fatty acids, which occur primarily in agricultural soils. The ratios between monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids seem to be very useful parameters of soil environmental conditions. In addition, on the basis of the differences in composition of the NEL-PLFA and hydroxy fatty acids of lipopolysaccharides, clear indications for the community structure of various soils were obtained. In the forest soils much more abundant anaerobic micro-organisms and relatively less abundant proteobacteria were present than in the other soils. In the cultivated soils, however, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria was considerably higher. Furthermore, eukaryotes appeared to be pre-dominant in the soils once used for a manure deposit site.},

	abstract = {Background, aim and scopeBiodiversity has been defined as the total number of species present, i.e. species richness or species abundance, and the distribution of individuals among those species, i.e. species evenness or species equitability. Recently, the biodiversity of soil biota is becoming increasingly essential with the requirement of preserving the integrity, function and long-term sustainability of natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this paper was to review, commonly used methods for the detection of microbial diversity in soils and characteristics of commonly presented soil bacterial communities. It is expected that this review could provide a platform for future studies of bacterial diversity in soils.Main featuresSoil is a complex, dynamic and living habitat for a large number of organisms. Bacteria are an important part of the soil micro-flora because of their abundance, their species diversity and the multiplicity of their metabolic activities. They also have the potential to reflect the past history of a given environment. It is therefore essential to understand the interrelationships between bacteria and their environment by studying the structural and functional diversity of soil bacterial communities and how they would respond to various natural or man-made disturbances. Conventional culture-dependent techniques have been used for the measurement of soil microbial composition, but only 0.1–1\% of soil bacteria are accessible by these approaches, which make the wide phylogenetic diversity remaining sparsely studied. Culture-independent molecular techniques can overcome this problem since they use DNA extracted directly from soils. Although the application of these molecular techniques has greatly improved the understanding of structures and dynamics of microbial communities in soils, it still has some limitations, for example the DNA is often extremely difficult to extract and purify from the organic-rich environmental samples. Different methods that complemented each other are recommended to combine the examination of soil microbial communities. Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods discover different phylogenetic information. Phyla Proteobacteria, Cytophagales, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are well represented by cultivated organisms and these four phyla account for 90\% of all cultivated bacteria characterised by 16S rRNA sequences. Some phyla which are revealed by clonal analysis, such as Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, are poorly represented by sequences from cultivated organisms.Conclusions and perspectivesIn conclusion, we have described soil component and compared culture-dependent and culture-independent methods in assessing bacterial diversity in soils. These methods are all feasible to assess the bacterial communities in soils; however, each method has its limitation and only provides a partial picture of one aspect of soil microbial diversity. It is suggested in this paper to combine different methods that complemented each other to obtain a more complete picture of bacterial diversity. The conflict information from studies using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods is also reviewed. It is found that members of four major phylogenetic groups are ubiquitous to almost all soil types: class α-proteobacteria and phyla Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia; phyla Proteobacteria, Cytophagales, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are well represented by cultivated organisms. New species and taxa are constantly described, adding to the bacterial list. Consequently, some species or even higher taxa may be transferred to a newly described taxon with more suitable descriptions. Described taxa may be merged together to form a more coherent arrangement, and high rank taxa may be sub-divided or even raised to a higher rank. Our knowledge of bacterial diversity on soils is limited because of the taxonomic and methodological limitations. There is a need now for further examining and comparing these methods to gain assurance that the best methods are used to assess bacterial communities and that we can interpret new information. The association between diversity and function will be clarified with our understanding increasing and knowledge expanding.},

Therefore, microorganisms should be included in soil quality classification and assessment concepts. The challenges of using microbial indicators are to identify the best choice among the many techniques available to assess soil quality and to convert the information obtained from the microbial indicator into a form relevant for policy makers. In this article, we present a wide range of possible microbial indicators, some of them standardized; each provides slightly different information on soil quality. Experience with the use of indicators for assessment of microbial communities and soil quality is discussed. At present, as many microbial indicators as possible should be included to gain experience. At a minimum, measures of microbial biomass, respiration, and N mineralization and a community profiling method (e.g., DGGE, PLFA, or CLPP) should be included.},

	abstract = {The occurrence and activity of fungi in a wheat-field soil has been investigated by plating techniques and by direct isolation. Over 210 fungi have been isolated. A high proportion of the fungi obtained by hyphal isolation are species which were rare or absent from dilution plates. In contrast to dilution methods, where the most abundant fungi isolated were species of Penicillium, Rhizopus, Mucor, Cladosporium and Fusarium, many fungi obtained from hyphae remain sterile in culture. Rhizoctonia solani, Ophiobolus graminis, Rhizoctonia spp. and several Basidiomycetes were obtained by hyphal isolation. Little difference in fungal count has been found between samples collected at 1 and 3 in., but significantly fewer fungal units were obtained from a subsurface horizon at 6 in. deep. Throughout the year fungi showed a well-marked periodicity, with highest numbers of viable units in the soil during the wet winter period. Both viable spores and viable hyphae were present in low numbers during the dry summer period; some fungi, however, survived the summer as hyphae. Bacterial and Actinomycete counts also showed a similar seasonal periodicity. Cultivation and incorporation of wheat residues with the soil greatly increased fungal numbers and activity, particularly in the neighbourhood of the residues. Bacterial numbers likewise increased greatly after cultivation, but Actinomycetes showed comparatively little change in number. The occurrence and activity of specific fungi are discussed. The data indicate that many species have very short periods of activity in the soil, but are always present.},

	abstract = {New non-tillage or reduced tillage agricultural practises are being increasingly adopted but generally result in higher soil compaction. Due to their recognised physical influence mainly through burrow creation, it is often claimed that earthworm activity could alleviate soil compaction in these systems. To put this assumption to the test, an experimental compaction event was carried out on one plot of arable land. The abundance and biomass of earthworms were evaluated in compacted (under wheel tracks) and non-compacted (between wheel tracks) zones, seven times over a two-year period. In addition, the functional consequences of earthworm activity, defined by burrow abundance assessed in 2D and 3D and water infiltration, were measured three times over the same period. The short-term (less than three months) effects of the compaction were clear: soil bulk density increased from 1.46 to 1.57 g cm−3, the abundance and biomass of earthworms were greatly reduced (−40\% and −70\% respectively) and the number and continuity of macroporosity were lower under wheel tracks at least until a depth of 30 cm. After these initial detrimental effects, we observed a rapid recovery of earthworm populations with no statistical difference between compacted and control zones more than three months after the compaction. However, the recovery of soil functional properties linked to earthworm activity, macroporosity and water infiltration, was much slower and took between 12 and 24 months. Despite these modifications, there were no significant changes in soil bulk density with time during the two-year period. This study demonstrates that earthworms are important actors in the regeneration of compacted soil. Although the complete regeneration of compacted soil by earthworms is a slow process, agricultural practises that promote earthworm density and activity should be encouraged in reduced or minimum tillage systems.},

Their functional and genetic potential may exceed that of higher organisms. Studies of bacterial diversity have been hampered by their dependence on phenotypic characterization of bacterial isolates. Molecular techniques have provided the tools for analyzing the entire bacterial community including those which we are not able to grow in the laboratory. Reassociation analysis of DNA isolated directly from the bacteria in pristine soil and marine sediment samples revealed that such environments contained in the order of 10 000 bacterial types. The diversity of the total bacterial community was approximately 170 times higher than the diversity of the collection of bacterial isolates from the same soil. The culturing conditions therefore select for a small and probably skewed fraction of the organisms present in the environment. Environmental stress and agricultural management reduce the bacterial diversity. With the reassociation technique it was demonstrated that in heavily polluted fish farm sediments the diversity was reduced by a factor of 200 as compared to pristine sediments. Here we discuss some molecular mechanisms and environmental factors controlling the bacterial diversity in soil and sediments.},

Four diversity measures were used: community level physiological profiles (CLPP), Bacteria-specific polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), actinomycete-specific PCR-DGGE and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), as well as total cell counts, colony-forming units (CFU) and culturable spore formers, and spore counts of the Bacillus cereus group. Analysis of non-treated plants provided a baseline description of the natural microbial succession from which effects of the treatments could be evaluated. A microbial succession occurred both in the rhizosphere and around decomposing roots, shown with all three diversity measures. A clear response to root death was found, and a clear distinction between root tip and root base samples. Using the recommended concentration of imazalil and a realistic number of DR54-BN14 for seed coating, transient, initial effects of both treatments on the microbial communities were observed at the root base with the PLFA analysis only. The lack of lasting significant side effects of DR54-BN14 is in agreement with an initial fast reduction in culturable DR54-BN14.},

Phosphate mineral apatite and a water solution of Pb, Zn, and Cd salts were previously homogeneously mixed into the soil material to reduce and to increase the proportion of bioavailable HM, respectively. The availability of Pb, Zn, and Cd was determined by HM fractionation and plant uptake 110 days after the addition of amendments, shortly before IPU addition. Apatite treatment reduced the availability of HM, but did not affect the microbial biomass and the microbial community structure on the genotype level (total soil DNA-RAPD). However, it changed the microbial community structure on the phenotype level, based on the composition of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) at the end of the degradation experiment. The degradation of IPU did not change. In contrast to apatite treatment, HM supplementation increased the bioavailability of Pb, Zn and Cd, which resulted in biomass reduction and changes of microbial community structure on the genotypic (total soil DNA-RAPD) and phenotypic (PLFA) level. Increased bioavailability of HM also significantly reduced the rate of IPU degradation and mineralisation. The total mineralisation over a period of 60 days decreased from 12 to 5\% of initial 14C. Increased HM bioavailability did not influence the degradation pathways and kinetics of IPU.},

We quantified respiratory losses of soil and biochar carbon and calculated mean residence times of the biochars using the isotopic label.

Mean residence times varied between 4 and 29 years, depending on soil type and quality of biochar. Yeast-derived biochar promoted fungi in the soil, while glucose-derived biochar was utilized by Gram-negative bacteria.

Crop cover by no-till management protects the soil surface, reducing the risk of erosion and nutrient leaching, but might increase straw residue-borne and soilborne plant-pathogenic fungi. A cross-site study of soil microbial communities and Fusarium fungistasis was conducted on six long-term agricultural fields with no-till and moldboard-plowed treatments. Microbial communities were studied at the topsoil surface (0 to 5 cm) and bottom (10 to 20 cm) by general bacterial and actinobacterial terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Fusarium culmorum soil fungistasis describing soil receptivity to plant-pathogenic fungi was explored by using the surface layer method. Soil depth had a significant impact on general bacterial as well as actinobacterial communities and PLFA profiles in no-till treatment, with a clear spatial distinction of communities (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the depth-related separation of microbial communities was not observed in plowed fields. The fungal biomass was higher in no-till surface soil than in plowed soil (P {\textless} 0.07). Soil total microbial biomass and fungal biomass correlated with fungistasis (P {\textless} 0.02 for the sum of PLFAs; P {\textless} 0.001 for PLFA 18:2ω6). Our cross-site study demonstrated that agricultural management strategies can have a major impact on soil microbial community structures, indicating that it is possible to influence the soil processes with management decisions. The interactions between plant-pathogenic fungi and soil microbial communities are multifaceted, and a high level of fungistasis could be linked to the high microbial biomass in soil but not to the specific management strategy.},

	abstract = {Numerous reports have emphasized the need for major changes in the global food system: agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population, with rising demand for meat and high-calorie diets, while simultaneously minimizing its global environmental impacts. Organic farming—a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans—is often proposed as a solution. However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices. Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5\% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13\% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34\% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions—that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions—organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.},

	abstract = {We characterised the spatial structure of soil microbial communities in an unimproved grazed upland grassland in the Scottish Borders. A range of soil chemical parameters, cultivable microbes, protozoa, nematodes, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, community-level physiological profiles (CLPP), intra-radical arbuscular mycorrhizal community structure, and eubacterial, actinomycete, pseudomonad and ammonia-oxidiser 16S rRNA gene profiles, assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were quantified. The botanical composition of the vegetation associated with each soil sample was also determined. Geostatistical analysis of the data revealed a gamut of spatial dependency with diverse semivariograms being apparent, ranging from pure nugget, linear and non-linear forms. Spatial autocorrelation generally accounted for 40-60\% of the total variance of those properties where such autocorrelation was apparent, but accounted for 97\% in the case of nitrate-N. Geostatistical ranges extending from approximately 0.6-6 m were detected, dispersed throughout both chemical and biological properties. CLPP data tended to be associated with ranges greater than 4.5 m. There was no relationship between physical distance in the field and genetic similarity based on DGGE profiles. However, analysis of samples taken as close as 1 cm apart within a subset of cores suggested some spatial dependency in community DNA-DGGE parameters below an 8 cm scale. Spatial correlation between the properties was generally weak, with some exceptions such as between microbial biomass C and total N and C. There was evidence for scale-dependence in the relationships between properties. PLFA and CLPP profiling showed some association with vegetation composition, but DGGE profiling did not. There was considerably stronger association between notional sheep urine patches, denoted by soil nutrient status, and many of the properties. These data demonstrate extreme spatial variation in community-level microbiological properties in upland grasslands, and that despite considerable numeric ranges in the majority of properties, overarching controlling factors were not apparent.},

Soil urease and phosphatase activity in soil samples from the plots of this field experiment was also determined. Total porosity was significantly higher in conventionally tilled plots, but the proportion of pores ranging from 30 to 500 μm in equivalent pore diameter, which are considered the most important both in soil-water-plant relationships and in the maintenance of a good soil structure, was higher in no-tilled plots. Root development showed a strict relationship with the presence of smaller pores which were more numerous in no-tilled plots. Enzyme activity was also higher in these plots than in the conventionally tilled plots. The relationships of such enzyme activities and the various pore size classes in each type of soil showed a positive common trend between the two enzyme activities and the percentage area of pores ranging from 30 to 200 μm in equivalent pore diameter. A significant correlation was observed between the degree of porosity in this range and urease activity.},

	abstract = {The enormous diversity available at the microbial level is just beginning to be realized. The richness of diversity amongst the bacteria that have been described so far is between 2 and 3000, whereas estimates indicates that millions of microorganisms still remains to be discovered. Microbiologists have realized that there are at least a dozen major evolutionary groups of the microbial life forms on earth (bacteria, fungi, algae and protozoa) that are even more diverse than the better known animal and plant kingdom. Indeed, we can state that microorganisms dominate the tree of life. Microorganisms have inhabited Earth for more than 3.7 billion years, whereas plants and animals have evolved rather recently in Earth’s history. Possible reports of evidence for microbial life on Mars is also consistent with the concept that microorganisms precede plants and animals on Earth. The applications of molecular-phylogenetic techniques have provided the tools for studying natural microbial communities, including those that we are not able to grow in the laboratory. The utilization of these techniques has resulted in the discovery of many new evolutionary lineages, some of them only distantly related to known organisms. Here I discuss some environmental factors controlling bacterial diversity in different environments and the utility of modern methods developed for describing this diversity.},

	abstract = {Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimetres. Biologic influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of aggregates but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies which create aggregations of particles and those which stabilize or degrade such aggregations. The formation of soil structure involves the physical forces of shrinking and swelling created by changes in water status of soils, freezing and thawing, tillage, or by movement of the larger biota in soils. Expansive properties of soils are controlled by the clay content. Thus changes of structural organisation are minimal in sands and maximal in clays. Plant roots, earthworms and other macrofauna large enough to move soil particles create pores recognisable by cylindrical shapes and smooth curved surfaces. Various visual and microscopic techniques aided by dyes are available to demonstrate the extent of biovoids in soils. Biology plays a major role in stabilization of soil structure. The major factors vary depending on the scale of soil structure. At larger scales plant roots and associated hyphae can be seen to enmesh soil particles by acting as a “sticky string bag”. At the microscale the influence of mucilages from roots, hyphae, bacteria and fauna such as earthworms can be shown by a range of microscopic techniques to be involved in stabilizing smaller aggregates and the linings of biopores. Techniques include optical and fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy including EDAX, transmission electron microscopy using heavy metals or other electron dense staining techniques for specific chemical compounds, and computer aided tomography. The microscopic techniques can be used on individual aggregates, stabilized soils, sections or separates of soils. Both microflora and fauna are involved in the degradation of stabilizing agents. Fauna may comminute roots and hyphae which stabilized larger aggregates and microorganisms utilize mucilaginous stabilizing agents as an energy source resulting in a slow breakdown of structural stability. Such effects can be established by combinations of studies of aggregation including microscopy. Further destruction of structure is caused by tillage and compaction by vehicles and animals.},

	abstract = {A series of closely related processes is presented, by which arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi contribute to the formation of relatively stable aggregate structures. Fibrous roots and AM fungal hyphae can be viewed as a “sticky-string bag” that contributes to the entanglement and enmeshment of soil particles to form macroaggregates, a basic building block of soil structure. Furthermore, AM fungi produce a glycoprotein, glomalin, that is deposited on their outer hyphal walls and on adjacent soil particles. Glomalin appears to be a rather stable hydrophobic glue that might reduce macroaggregate disruption during wetting and drying events by retarding water movement into the pores within the aggregate structure. Examples from various soil types are used to demonstrate the contributions of AM fungi to soil aggregation and its subsequent stabilization. Over a wide range of soil types, these contributions depend largely on broad textural characteristics and whether the soil’s structure is hierarchical in construction, among other factors.},

	abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems can be described by many different variables that include soil chemical, physical, and biological data. Whilst most of the chemical and physical properties variables that are relevant to soil quality are well understood, measures of soil biological properties so far have been much more difficult to use as decision support tools for monitoring soil quality. Descriptions of soil biological properties can range from single parameter variables such as microbial biomass or respiration to multiparametric data that describe biochemical profiles, measurements of enzyme activities, and molecular analyses of microbial communities. With the aim of developing practical measures of soil quality, integrative approaches are now being explored to sift out interrelationships between various types of variables. Among the different statistical tools applied, an increasing number of studies have used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to probe complex data sets. As an example of how ANN can be used, we provide an example analysis of soils from two different regions of Southeast Australia using Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) using data sets containing biochemical signatures of microbial communities determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), genetic signatures obtained by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP), and a range of single parameter soil chemical, physical, and biological variables. The visual output of the SOM analysis provides a rapid and intuitive means to examine covariance between variables and with minimal training could be useful for assisting land managers with interpretation of multiparametric soil analyses. Further development of these tools should also help soil scientists to identify novel relationships and devise research to explore linkages between the biological, chemical, and physical properties of soils.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research was to evaluate the change in physical properties of an arable clay soil following passage of rubber- and metal-tracked tractors in view of increased use of tracked tractors for ploughing on clay soil in centre-south and insular Italy. Field tests were carried out on arable soil cropped to lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) to compare two types of tracked tractors, one with rubber tracks (CAT Challenger Ch35) and one with metal tracks (FIAT FA 150) in order to establish the compacting effects resulting from one and four passes of the tractors on the same track. The following parameters were studied: soil penetration resistance, bulk density and its increment ratio, pressure distribution on soil along the length of the tracks, soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity. Multiple passes made by the two tractors induced very similar effects in the surface soil in regards to soil penetration resistance and dry bulk density. Mean values of penetration resistance (0 to 0.20m depth), were 2425kPa for rubber tracked tractor and 2415kPa for metal-tracked tractor; dry bulk density values were 1.52 and 1.48Mgm−3, respectively. The decrease in macroporosity, in particular that of elongated pores in the soil surface layer (0–0.10m depth) was greater in treatments involving the rubber-tracked tractor (from 10.6\% to 4.0\%) than for the metal-tracked tractor (from 10.6\% to 7.3\%). Following traffic of the two tractors hydraulic conductivity decreased and the lowest values were found after one and four passes of the rubber-tracked tractor (1.5 and 0.08mmh−1, respectively). A highly significant correlation between hydraulic conductivity and elongated pores and a significant correlation with total macroporosity were found. Significant exponential relationships between macroporosity and penetration resistance for one and four passes of both tractors were found in the surface soil. A significant difference was found between tractors and for correlations of penetration resistance values above control values. However, in the soil surface with respect to the higher degree of porosity, treatments involving the metal-tracked tractor showed better soil structure quality.},

Cedar-hemlock (CH) and hemlock-amabilis fir (HA) forests are both common on northern Vancouver Island, B.C., occurring adjacently across the landscape. CH forest floors have low nitrogen availability and HA high nitrogen availability. Total microbial biomass was assessed using chloroform fumigation-extraction and community composition was assessed using several cultivation-independent approaches: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the bacterial communities, ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) of the bacterial and fungal communities, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles of the whole microbial community. We did not detect differences in the bacterial communities of each forest type using DGGE and RISA, but differences in the fungal communities were detected using RISA. PLFA analysis detected subtle differences in overall composition of the microbial community between the forest types, as well as in particular groups of organisms. Fungal PLFAs were more abundant in the nitrogen-poor CH forests. Bacteria were proportionally more abundant in HA forests than CH in the lower humus layer, and Gram-positive bacteria were proportionally more abundant in HA forests irrespective of layer. Bacterial and fungal communities were distinct in the F, upper humus, and lower humus layers of the forest floor and total biomass decreased in deeper layers. These results indicate that there are distinct patterns in forest floor microbial community composition at the landscape scale, which may be important for understanding nutrient availability to forest vegetation.},

	abstract = {Although reduced tillage is an agricultural practice reported to decrease soil erosion and external inputs while enhancing soil fertility, it has still rarely been adopted by European organic farmers. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term interactive effects of tillage (conventional (CT) vs. reduced (RT)) and fertilization (slurry (S) vs. composted manure/slurry (MCS)) on earthworms and microbial communities in a clay soil under spelt in an organic 6-year crop rotation. Earthworm populations (species, density and biomass, cocoons) were investigated by handsorting the soil nine years after initial implementation of the treatments. Soil microbial carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) were measured by chloroform-fumigation extraction and a simplified phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to separate for populations of bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Significantly increased total earthworm density in RT plots was mainly attributed to increased numbers of juveniles. Moreover, we found five times more cocoons with RT. Species richness was not affected by the treatments, but tillage treatments had differentially affected populations at the species-level. In addition, cluster analysis at the community level revealed two distinct groups of plots in relation to tillage treatments. In RT plots Cmic increased in the 0–10cm and 10–20cm soil layers, while PLFA concentrations indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa only increased in the topsoil. Lower bacteria-to-fungi ratios in the upper soil layer of RT plots indicated a shift to fungal-based decomposition of organic matter whereas a higher Cmic-to-Corg ratio pointed towards enhanced substrate availability. Slurry application decreased microbial biomass and enhanced density of juvenile anecic earthworms but overall fertilization effect was weak and no interactions with tillage were found. In conclusion, tillage is a major driver in altering communities of earthworms and microorganisms in arable soils. The use of reduced tillage provides an approach for eco-intensification by enhancing inherent soil biota functions under organic arable farming.},

	abstract = {Soil microbiological parameters may be the earliest predictors of soil quality changes. Recently, molecular techniques such as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles have been used to characterize soil microbial communities. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from whole soil may be derived from live cells, dead cells, humic materials, as well as plant and root exudates. Our objective was to verify differences in FAME profiles from two agricultural soils with different plants. Soil samples were collected from Ritzville and Palouse silt loams for fatty acid analysis. Soil samples from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), jointed goatgrass ( Aegilops cylindrica L.) and downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) rhizospheres were also collected for fatty acid analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the two soils explained 42\% of the variance on PC1, which accounted for Palouse soil. Ritzville soil accounted for 19\% of the variance on PC2. Factor analysis showed that rhizosphere microbial communities from various plant species may differ depending on the plant species. Presence of Gram-positive bacteria as identified by a15:0, i15:0, a17:0 and i17:0 peaks were similar between rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils. Gram-negative bacteria characterized by short chain hydroxy acids (10:03OH and 12:03OH) as well as cyclopropane acids (cy17:0) were higher in rhizosphere soil than nonrhizosphere. This indicates a possible shift in the bacterial community to more Gram-negative bacteria and fewer Gram-positive bacteria in the rhizospheres of the plants species studied.},

	abstract = {The number of known species of fungi is estimated as at least 74 K, but could be as much as 120 K with allowances for ‘orphaned’ species. Yet in 1990 the magnitude of fungal diversity was estimated ‘conservatively’ at 1.5 M species. This figure has been widely accepted as a working hypothesis, but subsequent estimates have ranged from 500 K to 9.9 M and the bases of these suggestions are analyzed. Additional data pertinent to the estimation of the number of fungal species on Earth that has become available since 1990 is discussed. Site inventories demonstrate the need for long-term (20 yr plus) intensive studies to determine the number of species in a site. Fresh data sets on fungus:plant ratios and degrees of host specificity, especially from well-studied hosts in the tropics, are consistent with earlier estimates. The extent of novelty discovered in recent monographic generic revisions and studies of species in particular habitats varies from 0-96\%. Allowances for cryptic species, now known to be widespread by incompatibility and molecular studies, could on their own justify an upward revision by a factor of at least five. To enable confidence in any overall estimate to be increased, more detailed studies, especially on particular sites in the tropics, are needed. The consensus of tropical and molecular mycologists in particular is that an increased estimate could be justified. However, it is prudent to retain 1.5 M as the current working hypothesis for the number of fungi on Earth while additional data to test it further accumulates.},

Similarly, sporulation of this fungus appears to be unaffected by the suctions used but its intensity is severely diminished when the equivalent radius of the pores is reduced to 23μ or less (length of conidium is ca. 27μ.). Measurements of growth rate and observations on the morphology of C. ramosa show that growth is reduced and abnormal in grits with water-filled pores but that it is normal if the grits are drained and the pores are air-filled. It is suggested that the inhibitory effect of water-logging is due to reduced gaseous exchange.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to characterise soil microbial community structure and function in temperate upland grassland ecosystems. We compared the use of community level physiological profiles (CLPP), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and community DNA (\%G+C base distribution) approaches to quantify soil microbial community structure and potential activity across a gradient of three upland grassland types at 10 geographically distinct sites within the UK. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) was highest in unimproved (U4a) and lowest in improved (MG6) grasslands. In contrast, potential soil microbial activity (carbon utilisation) was greatest in the improved and lowest in the semi-improved (U4b) grasslands. PLFA and culturing revealed that the soil microbial community shifted from one favouring fungi to one favouring bacteria as grassland improvement increased. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) of the CLPP and PLFA data differentiated microbial communities from the grassland types and sites and the separation between grasslands was greater using PLFA than CLPP. Discrimination between grasslands was mainly due to the presence of higher concentrations of fatty acids typical for Gram −ve bacteria in improved grasslands and actinomycete and fungal fatty acids in the semi and unimproved grasslands. CVA of the \%G+C data gave less discrimination of the microbial communities than the other two methods. Correlation analysis of the CVA data for each microbial analysis showed a small, but significant, level of matching between the CLPP and PLFA data suggesting these two analyses may be reporting on similar members of the microbial community. Correlation between microbial community structure and soil physio-chemical properties indicated that PLFA were highly correlated with calcium, phosphorus, sodium, nitrogen and organic matter content and pH. CLPP were highly correlated with sodium and organic matter content and pH, while \%G+C content correlated with pH. Correlation between microbial community structure and plant community structure indicated that fatty acids typical for Gram −ve bacteria were highly correlated with the presence of Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens and all microbial PLFA with the presence of Vaccinium myrtillus. Correlation of plant species with CLPP indicated that the presence of a number of rushes, shrubs, herbs and grasses influenced the metabolic profiles of the microbial communities from these grasslands. The presence of herbs were found to be highly correlated with certain \%G+C classes within the community DNA.},

We examined microbial communities in winter wheat plots at two different points in the crop rotation (after potatoes and after maize). Employing extended polar lipid analysis up to 244 different phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and phospholipid ether lipids (PLEL) were detected. Higher concentrations of PLFA and PLEL in BIODYN and BIOORG indicated a significant influence of organic agriculture on microbial biomass. Farmyard manure (FYM) application consistently revealed the strongest, and the preceding crop the weakest, influence on domain-specific biomass, diversity indices and microbial community structures. Esterlinked PLFA from slowly growing bacteria (k-strategists) showed the strongest responses to long-term organic fertilization. Although the highest fungal biomass was found in the two organic systems of the DOK field trial, their contribution to the differentiation of community structures according to the management regime was relatively low. Prokaryotic communities responded most strongly to either conventional or organic farming management.},

We hypothesized that pooling data from two methods that characterized different components of soil biological communities would improve the resolution of fingerprints characterizing the effects of contrasting tillage and ground cover practices. By using supervised classifications of FAME and LH-PCR, a discriminant analysis procedure distinguished soils from contrasting tillage and ground cover management and predicted the origin of soil samples. Used independently, FAME provided higher resolution of tillage, ground cover, and field location than LH-PCR, but LH-PCR was effective at identifying field location. Pooling data from both methods did not enhance the predictive power. A comparison of linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and nonparametric density estimation demonstrated that minimizing assumptions about data distribution improved the capacity of FAME analysis to resolve differences in soil types. Use of a purely statistical Bayesian method to select a subset of fatty acids (FA's) as variables in discriminant analyses identified FA's that represented signature FA's for specific groups of organisms.},

The study was carried out between 2000 and 2006 as part of the long-term “cropping systems and soil structure” experiment conducted in Estrées-Mons in northern France. Soil hydraulic, mechanical and pore morphological properties were also measured to characterise the effects on soil structure dynamics. A complementary characterisation of the soil structure was conducted on a microscale. The method for morphological description of the soil macrostructure was well suited to studying soil structure dynamics in reduced tillage systems. Results showed that the soil structure in the layer without tillage depended in the first instance on compaction intensity. Structural porosity was partly preserved in the cropping system with little compaction. In contrast just one operation, such as the harvest of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), was sufficient to reduce structural porosity for 5 years even though no further compaction occurred during this period. Morphological analysis revealed the evolution of highly compacted zones under the effects of weather conditions. Platy soil structures were systematically observed in the upper part of the highly compacted zones under the tilled layers, with cracking slowly penetrating deeper into the soil with time. The structure types observed corresponded to specific soil properties resulting from the transformation of the soil structure over time. A micro-morphological assessment was performed to get detailed information about the network of cracks. The morphological characterisation showed that a visual morphological approach was insufficient for revealing the entire network of cracks.},
